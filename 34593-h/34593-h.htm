<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">CHAPTER I—Exciting News</a></h1>
<p>Bob Martin stood outside the large red
brick house and whistled. He whistled three
notes, a long and two short, which meant
to Hal Gregg inside that Bob wanted to
see him, and to see him quickly. Something
was up. At least, that was what it should
have meant to Hal, but evidently it didn’t,
because no answering whistle came out to
Bob, and no head appeared in any of the
windows.</p>
<p>Bob whistled again, this time a little more
shrilly, and he kept on whistling until a
pale, spectacled face appeared at an upstairs
window. The window was thrown open,
and Bob shouted up before Hal Gregg had
a chance to speak.</p>
<p>“Hey, what’s the idea of keeping me
waiting? Hurry up, come on down, I’ve
got something great to tell you.”</p>
<p>“Hold your horses. I didn’t hear you
whistle at first. I was reading,” called down
Hal.</p>
<p>Bob snorted. “Put it away and hurry up
down. Books can wait. You should hear
the news I’ve got to tell you.”</p>
<p>“The book’s swell,” said Hal. “It’s that
new book on aviation I got for my birthday.
Is your news more important than that?”</p>
<p>“You bet it is,” yelled Bob. “And if you
aren’t down here in two seconds, I’m going
to keep it to myself. And won’t you be
sorry!”</p>
<p>Hal laughed. “I’ll be down in one second.
I’m not going to have you knowing
anything I don’t know. You’re too smart
now.” The dark head disappeared from the
window, reappeared atop the narrow shoulders
of its owner at the front door within
a few seconds, bobbing about as he leaped
down the front steps two at a time. Hal
Gregg joined his pal Bob under the maple
tree on the Gregg front lawn.</p>
<p>The two boys made a strange contrast as
they flung themselves down in the shade of
the tree. They were the same age, sixteen,
with Hal having a little edge on his friend.
But Bob could have passed for the other
boy’s big brother. He was a full head taller,
his shoulders were broader, his complexion
ruddier. He was the typical outdoor
boy, with tousled brown hair, a few unruly
freckles, and a broad pleasant face. Hal Gregg
was short and slight, with sloping narrow
shoulders. His complexion was dark, and
his large, serious eyes were hidden behind
shell-rimmed eye-glasses. Yet though they
were such a badly matched team, the two
boys were fast friends.</p>
<p>Their friendship had begun strangely. In
the first place, they lived next door to each
other, on a quiet, shady side-street in the
large city of Crowley. Bob had lived there
first, while the red brick house next to his
had been empty for a long time. Nobody
Bob’s age had ever lived in that house, and
he had grown to look at it as an old fogey
sort of a house, very dull, and fit only for
grownups. It didn’t seem as though young
people could ever live in it. So he’d been
pretty much excited when he found out that
the house had been sold, and that a boy his
own age was going to move in.</p>
<p>But his first glimpse of Hal was a disappointed
one. “Oh, golly, just my luck,”
he said to his mother. “Somebody my own
age moves in next door at last, and look
what he turns out to be.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin had also caught a glimpse
of Hal as he had got out of the automobile
with his mother, and entered the house. “He
seems to me to be a very nice boy,” she said
quietly.</p>
<p>“Nice! That’s just the point. He looks
as though he’s so nice he’ll be as dull as
ditchwater. I’ll bet he’s the kind that can’t
tell one airplane from another, and buys
his radio sets all made up, with twenty tubes
and all kinds of gadgets. Lot of fun I’ll
have with him!”</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin smiled and said nothing. She
was a wise mother. She knew that if she
praised Hal too much he would seem just
so much worse in her son’s eyes. So she resolved
to let him decide for himself, just as
she always let him decide, whether he wanted
Hal for a friend or not.</p>
<p>For several days Bob saw nothing of Hal,
but one day, as he rode his bicycle up the
driveway that separated the two houses, he
heard someone hail him. He looked over
into the Gregg yard and saw Hal there,
stretched out in a steamer chair, an open
book in his lap. He looked very small and
puny. Bob got down from his bike. He
was embarrassed. Hal hailed him again.
“Come on over,” he called.</p>
<p>Bob got down and walked over to where
the other boy was sitting. The meeting between
two strange boys is usually a hard
one, with suspicion on both sides. But Hal
seemed surprisingly pleasant. “I’ve seen you
riding around,” he said, “but I haven’t had
a chance to call you before. I’m Hal Gregg.
You’re Bob, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” grinned Bob. He was beginning
to think that this Hal might not be such
a bad sort. “How did you know?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m a Sherlock Holmes. Anyway,
I’ve heard your mother calling to you.
And if she calls you ‘Bob,’ that must be
your name.”</p>
<p>Bob laughed, “You’re right, she ought
to know,” he said. But he didn’t know
what to say next. Hal filled in the gap.</p>
<p>“You go swimming a lot, and bicycling,
don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Bob replied. “That’s about all a
fellow likes to do in summer. Don’t you
swim?”</p>
<p>Hal’s forehead wrinkled. “My mother
doesn’t like me to go swimming,” he said.
“I’ve never had a bike, either. You see, my
mother’s always afraid that something’ll happen
to me. She hasn’t got anybody but
me, you know. I haven’t got a father, or
any other family. I guess that’s what makes
Mother so anxious about me.”</p>
<p>“My mother never seems to worry very
much about me,” said Bob. “At least, she
never shows it.”</p>
<p>Hal looked at Bob enviously. “You don’t
have to be worried about,” he said. “You’re
as husky as they come.”</p>
<p>Bob felt himself getting warm. This
wasn’t the way for a fellow to talk. All
of his friends called each other “shrimp”
or “sawed-off,” no matter how big and husky
they might be. None of them ever showed
such poor taste as to compliment a
fellow. He guessed, and correctly, that Hal
hadn’t been with boys enough to learn the
proper boy code of etiquette. But he just
said, “Aw, I’m not so husky,” which was
the proper answer to a compliment, anyway.</p>
<p>“You sure are,” said Hal. “You see, I
was a sickly child, and had to be taken care
of all the time. I’m all right now, but my
mother doesn’t seem to realize it. She still
treats me as though I was about to break
out with the measles any minute. I guess
that’s about all I used to do when I was a
kid.”</p>
<p>“With measles?” laughed Bob. “I thought
that you could get those only once.”</p>
<p>“Oh, if it wasn’t measles, then something
else. Anyway, here I am.”</p>
<p>Bob’s opinion of the boy had sunk lower
and lower. He saw that they weren’t going
to get on at all. Why, the boy was nothing
but a mollycoddle, and not much fun.
“What do you do for fun?” he asked, curiously.</p>
<p>“Oh, I read a lot,” said Hal, picking up
the book in his lap.</p>
<p>Bob’s mind was now more firmly made
up. A fellow who spent all his time
reading was no fun at all. And he needn’t think
that Bob was going to encourage any friendship,
either. “What’s the book?” he asked.</p>
<p>“A biography,” said Hal.</p>
<p>“Biography!” thought Bob, but he looked
at the title. It was a life of Admiral
Byrd.</p>
<p>Bob’s eyes lighted up. “Oh, say,” he
said, “is that good?”</p>
<p>“It’s great,” said Hal. “You know, I
read every book on aviators that comes out.
I’ve always wanted to be one—an aviator,
you know.”</p>
<p>Bob sat up and took notice. “Gee, you
have? Why, so have I. My Uncle Bill’s
an aviator. You ought to know him. He
was in the war. Joined when he was just
eighteen. I’m going to be an aviator, too.”</p>
<p>“You are? Have you ever been up?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Bob, “but I’m going some
day. Bill’s going to teach me how to pilot
a plane. He’s promised. He’s coming to
visit us some time and bring his own plane.
Dad takes me out to the airport whenever
he can, and we watch the planes. I’ve never
had a chance to go up, though.”</p>
<p>Hal’s eyes clouded. “I hope you get to
be an aviator,” he said, “I don’t think that
I ever shall. My mother’d never allow me
to go up.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sure, she would,” consoled Bob, “if
you wanted to badly enough. Have you
ever built a plane? A model, I mean?”</p>
<p>“Have I? Dozens. One of them flew,
too. You’ve got to come up to my workshop
and see them,” said Hal eagerly. “I
read every new book that comes out. I
think that airplanes are the greatest thing
out.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got to see my models, too. I
made a <em>Spirit of St. Louis</em> the year that Lindy
flew across the Atlantic. Of course it
isn’t as good as my later ones. Say, we’re
going to have a swell time, aren’t we?” At
that moment Bob knew that he and Hal
were going to be good friends.</p>
<p>And good friends they were. There were
a great many things about Hal that annoyed
Bob no end at first. Hal was, without a
doubt, his mother’s boy. He was afraid of
things—things that the fearless Bob took for
granted. He was afraid of the dark—afraid
of getting his feet wet—afraid of staying
too late and worrying his mother. And then
he was awkward. Bob tried gradually to
initiate him into masculine sports—but it
irked him to watch Hal throw a ball like a
girl, or swim like a splashing porpoise. But
he had to admit that Hal tried. And when
he got better at things, it was fun teaching
him. Bob felt years older than his pupil,
and gradually came to take a protective attitude
toward him that amused his mother.</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin smiled one day when Bob
complained about Hal’s awkwardness in
catching a ball. “Well,” she said, “you may
be teaching Hal things, but he’s teaching you,
too, and you should be grateful to him.”</p>
<p>“What’s he teaching me?” asked Bob, surprised.</p>
<p>“I notice, Bob, that you’re reading a
great deal more than you ever have. I think
that that’s Hal’s influence.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that,” said Bob, “why, we read
the lives of the famous flyers, that’s all. Why,
that’s fun. That’s not reading.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin smiled again, and kept her
customary silence.</p>
<p>The strange friendship, founded on the
love of airplanes, flourished. The boys were
always together, and had invented an
elaborate system of signals to communicate with
each other at such times as they weren’t with
one another. Two crossed flags meant
“Come over at once.” One flag with a black
ball on it meant “I can’t come over.” These
flags, usually limp and bedraggled by the
elements horrified the parents of both Bob
and Hal when they saw them hanging in
various intricate designs out of windows and
on bushes and trees in the garden. But since
they seemed necessary to the general scheme
of things, they were allowed to go unmolested,
even in the careful Gregg household.</p>
<p>The friendship had weathered a summer,
a school year, and was now entering the
boys’ summer vacation again. It was at the
beginning of this vacation that Bob whistled
to Hal and called to him to come down to
hear his wonderful news.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Hal, “spill the news.” It
must be said of Hal that he tried even to
master the language of the real boy in his
education as a good sport.</p>
<p>“Bill’s coming,” said Bob, trying to hide
his excitement, but not succeeding very well.</p>
<p>“What?” shouted Hal.</p>
<p>“Sure, Captain Bill’s coming to spend the
summer with us. He’s flying here in his
own plane.”</p>
<p>“Oh, golly,” said Hal, and could say no
more.</p>
<p>Captain Bill was the boys’ patron saint.
It had been through his uncle Bill that Bob
Martin had developed his mania for flying.
Captain Bill Hale was Bob’s mother’s youngest
brother, the adventurous member of the
family, who had enlisted in the Canadian
army when he was eighteen, at the outbreak
of the war. When the United States joined
the big battle, he had gone into her air corps
to become one of the army’s crack flyers,
with plenty of enemy planes and blimps to
his credit. A crash had put him out of commission
at the end of the war, but had not
dulled his ardor for flying. For years he
had flown his own plane both for commercial
and private reasons.</p>
<p>As Bob’s hero, he had always written to
the boy, telling him of his adventures, encouraging
him in his desire to become an aviator.
He had never found the time actually
to visit for any length of time with his sister
and her family, but had dropped down
from the sky on them suddenly and unexpectedly
every so often.</p>
<p>But now, as Bob explained carefully to
Hal, he was coming for the whole summer,
and was going to teach him, Bob, to fly.</p>
<p>“Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,” Bob chortled,
“what a break! Captain Bill here
for months, with nothing to do but fly us
around.”</p>
<p>Hal did not seem to share his friend’s enthusiasm.
“Fly us around? Not us, Bob,
old boy—you. My mother will never let
me go up.” Hal’s face clouded.</p>
<p>Bob slapped him on the back. “Oh, don’t
you worry. Your mother will let you fly.
She’s let you do a lot of things with me
that she never let you do before. We’ll get
her to come around.”</p>
<p>But Hal looked dubious. “Not that, I’m
afraid. She’s scared to death of planes, and
gets pale if I even mention flying. But
that’s all right. I’ll do my flying on the
ground. You and Bill will have a great
time.”</p>
<p>“Buck up,” said Bob. “Don’t cross your
bridges until you come to them. We’ll work
on your mother until she thinks that flying
is the safest thing in the world. And it is,
too. We’ll let Captain Bill talk to her. He
can make anybody believe anything. He’ll
have her so thoroughly convinced that she’ll
be begging him to take you up in the air to
save your life. See if he doesn’t! Bill is
great!”</p>
<p>Hal was visibly improved in spirits.
“When’s Bill coming in?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Six tonight,” said Bob. “Down at the
airport. Dad says that he’ll drive us both
out there so that we can meet Captain Bill,
and drive him back. Gee, wouldn’t it be
great if he had an autogyro and could land
in our back yard?”</p>
<p>“Maybe he’ll have one the next time he
comes. What kind of plane is he flying?”</p>
<p>“His new Lockheed. It’s a monoplane, he
says, and painted green, with a reddish nose.
It’s green because his partner, Pat, wanted
it green. Pat’s been his buddy since they
were over in France together, and anything
that Pat says, goes. It’s got two cockpits,
and dual controls. It’s just great for teaching
beginners. That means us, Hal, old boy.
Listen, you’d better get ready. Dad will be
home soon, and will want to start down for
the port. Say, does that sound like thunder?”</p>
<p>The boys listened. It did sound like
thunder. In fact, it was thunder. “Golly,
I hope it doesn’t storm. Mother won’t let
me go if it rains.”</p>
<p>Bob laughed. “I wouldn’t worry about
you getting wet if it stormed,” he said.
“What about Bill, right up in the clouds?
Of course, he can climb over the storm if it’s
not too bad. But you hurry anyhow. We’ll
probably get started before it rains, anyway.”</p>
<p>At ten minutes to six Hal, Bob and Bob’s
father were parked at the airport, their necks
stretched skyward, watching the darkening,
clouded skies for the first hint of a green
monoplane. No green monoplane did they
see. A few drops of rain splattered down,
then a few more, and suddenly the outburst
that had been promising for hours poured
down. Bob’s father, with the aid of the two
boys, put up the windows of the car, and
they sat fairly snug while the rain teemed
down about them. The field was becoming
sodden. Crashes of lightning and peals of
thunder seemed to flash and roll all about
them. All of the airplanes within easy
distance of their home port had come winging
home like birds to an enormous nest. The
three watchers scanned each carefully, but
none was the green Lockheed of Captain Bill.</p>
<p>The time passed slowly. Six-thirty; then
seven. Finally Mr. Martin decided that they
could wait no longer. “He’s probably landed
some place to wait for the storm to lift,”
he said. “He can take a taxi over to the
house when he gets in.”</p>
<p>Reluctant to leave, the boys nevertheless
decided that they really couldn’t wait all
night in the storm for Captain Bill, and
so they started for home.</p>
<p>Very wet, and bedraggled, and very, very,
hungry, they arrived. Hal’s mother was practically
hysterical, met him at the door, and
drew him hastily into the house.</p>
<p>Mr. Martin and his son ran swiftly from
the garage to the back door of their house,
but were soaked before they got in. Entering
the darkened kitchen, they could hear
voices inside.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t that sound like—why, it is—that’s
Bill’s voice,” shouted Bob. The light
switched on, and Bill and Mrs. Martin came
into the kitchen to greet their prodigal relatives.</p>
<p>“Hello,” said Bill, “where have you people
been? You seem to be wet. Shake on it.”</p>
<p>“Well, how in the—how did you get in?”
shouted Mr. Martin, pumping Bill’s hand.
“We were waiting in the rain for you for
hours.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Bill, contritely, “we tried
to get in touch with you, but we couldn’t.
You see, I came in by train.”</p>
<p>“By train!” exclaimed Bob. “By train!”</p>
<p>“Why, sure,” laughed the Captain, “Why,
aren’t you glad to see me without my plane?
That’s a fine nephewly greeting!”</p>
<p>“Oh, gee, Bill, of course I’m glad to see
you, but—well, I’ve sort of been counting
on your bringing your plane.”</p>
<p>Bill laughed. “The plane’s coming all
right,” he said. “We had a little accident
the other day, and the wing needed repairing.
I decided not to wait for it, but to come
in on the train to be with you. So Pat
McDermott is bringing the plane in in a
few days. Is that all right? May I stay?”</p>
<p>“Yup, you can stay,” said Bob. “But
I want something to eat!”</p>
<p>“Everything’s ready,” said Mrs. Martin.
“You change your clothes, and come right
down to dinner.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” said Bob. But he did not
change immediately. He stopped first to put
two crossed flags in the window, which
meant to Hal, “Come right over.”</p>

<div class="section" id="chapter-iicaptain-bill">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">CHAPTER II—Captain Bill</a></h1>
<p>Hal couldn’t come right over. He had to
be fussed over, steamed, dosed, and put to
bed so that he would suffer no ill effects
from his soaking that evening. But he was
over bright and early the next morning. It
had rained all night, and was still raining
in a quiet, steady downpour, when Hal appeared
at the Martin home, dressed in rubbers,
raincoat, muffler, and carrying an umbrella
to protect him on his long trek from
his own front door to his friend’s. Captain
Bill would have been startled at the strangely
bundled figure of Hal, but he had been
warned, and greeted Hal without a blink of
an eyelash. In fact, as soon as Hal had been
unwrapped from his many coverings, and
had spoken to them all, Captain Bill discovered
that he was probably going to like
this boy after all, and was pleased that his
nephew had such good judgment in choosing
a friend and companion.</p>
<p>They talked that morning, of course,
about airplanes, and the boys told how they
had been reading about the famous flyers,
and of their hopes to be flyers themselves
some day. Bill had been a good listener, and
had said very little, but after lunch Hal said
what had been on his chest for a long time.</p>
<p>“Captain Bill, we’ve been doing all the
talking. Why don’t you tell us a story?”</p>
<p>The Captain laughed. “I think that Bob’s
heard all my stories. I’m afraid that they’re
a little moth-eaten now. But how about
the two of you telling me a story? Some
of the things that you’ve been reading so
carefully. How about it?”</p>
<p>“We can’t tell a story the way you can,
old scout,” said Bob. “Anyway, we asked
you first.”</p>
<p>“All right, I’m caught,” said the Captain.
“But I’ll tell you a story only on one condition.
Each of you has to tell one too.
That’s only fair, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Bob and Hal looked at each other. Hal
spoke. “I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” he
said, blushing. “I can’t tell stories, I’m sure
I can’t.”</p>
<p>Captain Bill knew that it would be tactless
at that moment to try to convince Hal
that he could tell a story. It would only increase
the boy’s nervousness, and convince
him only more of the fact that he could not
spin a yarn. So he said, “Well, we’ll tell
ours first, and you can tell yours later. After
you hear how bad ours are, you’ll be encouraged.”
Then Bill had an idea. “How
about having a contest?” he said. “The one
who tells the best story gets a prize.”</p>
<p>“What prize?” asked Bob quickly.</p>
<p>“Now, you take your time. We’ll decide
on the prize later. We’ll have to let Pat
in on this, too, I suppose, but he’s going to
give us some competition. Pat’s a great story
teller. I’ll tell my story first. Then Bob can
tell his, after he’s had some time for preparation;
then Pat will probably want to get
his licks in; and Hal will come last. He’ll
have the benefit of our mistakes to guide him.
How about it?”</p>
<p>“All right with me,” said Bob, eagerly.
He was keen about the idea.</p>
<p>But Hal seemed less enthusiastic. His natural
reticence, he felt, would make it torture
for him to tell a story. It would be all right
just for Bob—and he was even getting well
enough acquainted with Captain Bill to
tell his story in front of him—but this Pat
McDermott—even his name sounded formidable.
Captain Bill didn’t give him a chance
to say aye, yea, or nay, but went on talking.</p>
<p>“I think that we ought to choose subjects
that you two know about,” said Bill. “How
about stories of the aviators—of Famous
Flyers and their Famous Flights?”</p>
<p>“Great!” said Bob. “Gee, I want Lindbergh.”</p>
<p>“Lindbergh you shall have,” said Captain
Bill. “What’s yours Hal?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Hal. “I’ll have to
think it over. But—I think that I’d like
to take the life of Floyd Bennett—if I may.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Bill. “I think that I’ll
tell about Admiral Byrd—do you think he’d
make a good story?”</p>
<p>“Marvelous!” said Bob, with his usual enthusiasm.
“What’ll we leave for Pat?”</p>
<p>“Pat can take whomever he wants to take,”
the Captain said. “He’ll have to take what’s
left. That’s what he gets for coming late.
But what do you say we wait to start the
contest when Pat comes?”</p>
<p>“Yes, oh, yes, I think that that would be
much better,” said Hal, relieved that the ordeal
would at least be postponed, even if it
could not be avoided altogether. “I think
that we ought to wait until Mr. McDermott
comes.”</p>
<p>The Captain laughed. “Don’t let him hear
you call him ‘Mr. McDermott’” he said.
“He’s Pat to everybody, and to you, too.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try to remember,” said Hal, miserably,
thinking of what a complicated world
this was.</p>
<p>It was still raining outside. The boys and
the Captain, seated in the library, or rather,
sprawled in the library, could see the streams
of rain splash against the windows and run
down in little rivers until they splashed off
again at the bottom of the pane.</p>
<p>Captain Bill yawned and stretched. “Not
much to do on a day like this. I’m mighty
anxious to get out to the airport as soon
as it clears up. What’ll we do?”</p>
<p>Bob had an idea. “Couldn’t we sort of
sneak one over on Pat?” he said. “Couldn’t
we have a story, one not in the contest, now?
It wouldn’t count, really, and it would give
us a little rehearsal before Pat gets here.”</p>
<p>“Who’s going to tell this story?” asked
Captain Bill, looking just a bit suspiciously
at his nephew.</p>
<p>Bob grinned. “Well, I thought that maybe
you would. Seeing that you’re the best
story-teller anyway.”</p>
<p>“Go long with your blarney. But I guess
I will tell you one. It will be a sort of prologue
to the rest of our stories. It’s about
the very first flyers and the very first famous
flight.”</p>
<p>“The Wrights?” asked Hal.</p>
<p>“The Wrights,” said the Captain. “Wilbur
and Orville, and their first flight at Kitty
Hawk, North Carolina.”</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="chapter-iiithe-wright-brothers">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">CHAPTER III—The Wright Brothers</a></h1>
<p>The Captain had first to fill his pipe, and
stretch his legs before he began his story.</p>
<p>“Of course,” he said, “we can’t really say
that the Wrights were the first men to fly,
or to build a machine that would fly. Even
in the middle ages Leonardo da Vinci drew
up plans for a flying machine. Just before
the Wright’s experiment Langley had stayed
up in the air in a machine invented and
built by himself. If he had not died at so
unfortunate a period in his experimental life,
perhaps he might have been the inventor of
the airplane.</p>
<p>“The Wrights invented the airplane in
the same degree that Thomas Edison
invented the electric light. Men had experimented
with both inventions for many years.
But it took the genius of the Wrights, the
genius of an Edison to bring together these
experiments, to think through logically just
wherein they were right and where they were
wrong, and to add the brilliant deductions
that brought their experiments to a practical
and successful end. Edison’s discovery was
dependent upon the finding of the proper
filament for his bulb; the Wrights’ success
hinged upon their discovery of the warped
wing, which gave them control over their
plane.</p>
<p>“The fact that the Wrights were not the
first to fly does not detract from the thing
that they actually did. At the time that
they were making their first flying machine,
any man who tampered with the subject of
flying through the air was looked upon as
crazy. And this was not more than a quarter
of a century ago. Seems funny, doesn’t
it? But they were not to be discouraged.
They knew that they were right, and they
went ahead. They had many set-backs.
Their planes were wrecked. What did they
do? They just built them over again, and
were glad that they had learned of some new
defect that they could re-design and correct.</p>
<p>“You notice that I always talk of ‘the
Wrights’ as though they were one person;
everybody does. In fact, they almost were
one person. They were always together;
lived together, played together, although they
didn’t play much, being a serious pair, and
worked together. They never quarreled, never
showed any jealousy of each other, never
claimed the lion’s share of praise in the invention.
They were just ‘the Wrights,’ quiet,
retiring men, who did much and talked little.</p>
<p>“From early childhood it was the same.
Wilbur Wright, the elder of the two, was
born in Milville, Indiana, and lived there
until he was three years old with his parents,
Milton Wright, bishop of the United Brethren
Church, and Susan Katherine Wright. In
1870 the family moved to Dayton, Ohio,
and in 1871 Orville Wright was born. From
a very early age the two were drawn to each
other. Their minds and desires were similar.</p>
<p>“When Wilbur decided that he would
rather go to work after being graduated
from High School, Orville decided that he,
too, would give up his formal education,
and devote himself to mechanics.</p>
<p>“They were born mechanics, always building
miniature machines that actually worked.
They did not stop studying, but took to
reading scientific works that were of more
help to them than formal education. In this
way they learned printing, and built themselves
a printing press out of odds and ends
that they assembled. On this they began
to publish a little newspaper, but they gave
this up when another opportunity presented
itself.</p>
<p>“Bicycles were coming in at that time,
and the Wright brothers set up a little shop
to repair them. From the repair shop they
developed a factory in which they manufactured
bicycles themselves. Their business
was very successful, and they were looked
upon as young men who were likely to get
along in the world. This was in 1896.</p>
<p>“That year Otto Lilienthal, a famous German
experimenter, was killed in his glider,
just at the peak of his career. Wilbur read
an account of his death in the newspaper,
and discussed it with his brother. The event
renewed the interest that they had always
had in flying, and they set about studying
all of the books that they could find on the
problem of flight. They soon exhausted all
that they could get, and decided that their
groundwork had been laid. From then on
their work was practical, and they discovered
principles that had never been written,
and which resulted in the first flight.</p>
<p>“The first things that they built were kites,
and then gliders that were flown as kites.
The Wrights were after the secret of the
birds’ flight, and felt that they could apply
it to man’s flight. Their next step was the
construction of a real glider. But the country
around Dayton was not favorable for
flying their craft. They wrote to the United
States government to find a region that had
conditions favorable to their gliding. That
is how the obscure Kitty Hawk, North Carolina,
came to be the famous place that it is.
It happened to have just south of it three
hills, Kill Devil Hill, Little Hill, and West
Hill. Between the hills was soft drifting sand,
that would provide a better landing place
than hard earth in case of a spill. The winds
were steady and moderate.</p>
<p>“To Kitty Hawk the Wrights went. Here
they glided to their heart’s content, until
they decided that they had learned to control
their flights, and were ready to build a
plane with power. They went back to Dayton
in 1902. They designed and supervised
the building of the motor themselves, one
that would generate twelve horsepower. Satisfied,
they set out once more for Kitty
Hawk, with the motor and parts of their
plane carefully stowed away.</p>
<p>“They got down there in the early autumn,
but found so many difficulties to
overcome, that they could not make the
first tests until December. In the first place,
they discovered that a storm had blown away
the building which they had built to work
in when they first got to Kitty Hawk. However,
everything was at last ready, the weather
favorable, and the plane was hauled up
Kill Devil Hill, and guided toward the single
track of planks that had been laid down
the hill.</p>
<p>“Who was going to get the first chance
to pilot the plane? Who was going to be
the first man to fly? Orville insisted that
Wilbur be the one; Wilbur insisted that
Orville should be the first. They decided it
by flipping a coin. Wilbur won. He got
into the plane, unfastened the wire that held
the plane to the track, and started down. He
ended in a heap at the bottom of the hill, uninjured,
but with several parts of the plane
damaged.</p>
<p>“The Wrights were nothing daunted.
They repaired the plane as quickly as possible,
and on December 17, they were ready
for the second trial. It was Orville’s turn,
of course. He unloosened the wire; the plane
started down the hill; at the end of a forty-foot
run it rose into the air. It kept on
going, in a bumpy, irregular course, now
swooping up, now diving down, for 120
feet, then darted to earth. The flight had
taken in all just twelve seconds, but the
Wrights had flown.</p>
<p>“I suppose you’ve seen pictures of that
first plane. It wasn’t much more than a box
in shape, a biplane, with no cockpit at all,
just the wings held together by struts, and
a seat in the center for the pilot. A man had
to be tough to fly one of those planes. The
wonder is that any of them escaped with
their lives. They had to sit up there exposed
to all the elements, and pilot the clumsy
planes. And yet they grew into skilful
and expert pilots, and could loop the loop
and figure eight in them! The Wrights
themselves were excellent flyers. This seems
only natural, with their natural born gift
for mechanics. It was well that they were
good flyers, because it was up to them to
prove to the world that their craft was safe,
and practical.</p>
<p>“It was hard at first. People were skeptical
as to whether the Wrights really had a
ship that flew. Some of their tests were unsuccessful,
and they were laughed to scorn.
However, France, who had been more advanced
than the United States in the matter
of experimentation in flying, became interested
in the new flying machine, and sent
representatives over to the United States to
inspect it. With the French approving of
it, the United States became more interested.
The government offered a prize of $25,000,
for anyone who would build a plane that
would travel 40 miles an hour, carry enough
fuel and oil to cruise for 125 miles, and
fly continuously for at least an hour, with
two persons weighing together 350 pounds.
The Wrights built such a machine, and the
government not only gave them the $25,000,
but an additional $5,000 besides.</p>
<p>“In the meanwhile Wilbur Wright had
gone to France, where he participated in
many flights, and won the hearts of the
French people by staying in the air for an
hour and a half. At the end of the year,
1908, he stayed in the air over two hours.</p>
<p>“The Wrights were showing what they
could do. Flying became the rage. Society
took it up, and traveled to the Wrights to
see their planes. But the Wrights, no more
impressed by this than they were by anything
else, kept right on working. They
were financed by a group of able financiers
in the United States, and founded the Wright
Aeroplane Company for the manufacture of
planes, and they were content.</p>
<p>“After 1909, their point proved, the
Wrights did very little flying. They spent
their time in engineering problems, making
improvements on the planes that they were
designing and manufacturing.</p>
<p>“They did some more experimenting with
gliders, but this was in order to perfect the
art of soaring.</p>
<p>“In May, 1912, Wilbur Wright died, and
broke up the famous partnership that had
existed for so many years. Since his death
his brother has lived quietly. He has not
flown, and has acted as advisor to his company
as they turn out more and more modern
planes. He is one man who has lived to see
a thing that he started himself grow into
a blessing to mankind. And if the airplane
isn’t that, I’d like to know what is.”</p>
<p>“I think so,” said Bob.</p>
<p>“Who are you to think so?” asked Bill,
sitting up very suddenly.</p>
<p>Bob was non-plussed for a moment, but
then saw that his uncle was joking, and
laughed. They were interrupted by the ringing
of the doorbell.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the Captain, “who could be
out in weather like this?”</p>
<p>They heard the front door open, voices,
and then the closing of the door. In a short
while the footsteps of Mrs. Martin sounded
on the steps, and she entered the library.</p>
<p>“A telegram for you, Bill,” she said, and
handed it to him. “My, you three look cozy
up here. I suppose you’ve been yarning,
haven’t you?” She gave her brother a playful
poke.</p>
<p>Captain Bill, who had risen when his sister
came in, offered his chair before he opened
the telegram. “Join us, won’t you, Sis?”</p>
<p>His sister laughed. “I really can’t go before
I see what is in the telegram,” she said.
“Of course, I suppose I should be polite and
pretend not to be interested in it, but I am.
We all are, aren’t we, boys?”</p>
<p>Bob and Hal grinned.</p>
<p>“Well, then,” said Bill, “I guess I’ll have
to see what’s in it.” He opened the telegram,
and glanced hurriedly over it. “Pat’s
landing tomorrow,” he said. “He wants us
to be out at the airport to see the <em>Marianne</em>
come in.”</p>
<p>“Hurray!” shouted Bob, and went into a
war dance.</p>
<p>His mother looked at him tolerantly. She
was used to Bob’s antics. “What time is
Pat coming in?” she asked.</p>
<p>“He didn’t say. In fact, that’s all he didn’t
say in this telegram. But I guess he’ll
start out about dawn and get here around
noon. Anyway, we’ll be going down to the
airport tomorrow morning to look around.
We’ll stay there until that Irishman rolls
in.”</p>
<p>“What will you do about lunch?” asked
the practical Mrs. Martin.</p>
<p>“Why, we’ll eat at the airport restaurant,”
said Bill. “Don’t worry about us, Sis.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin looked dubious. She glanced
at Hal. She knew that Hal’s mother liked
to supervise her son’s meals, and did not
care to have him eat at strange places. Mrs.
Martin felt that it would be a shame to spoil
the expedition for such a trivial reason, so
she said, “I have an idea. I’ll pack a lunch
for all of you tonight, and you can take it
with you tomorrow. How will that be?
You can eat it anyplace around the airport.
It’ll be a regular picnic. There are some nice
places around the port that you can go to.
How about that?”</p>
<p>Bob answered for them. “That will be
great. Gee, Bill, do you remember the picnic
baskets that Mom can pack? We’re in
luck.”</p>
<p>“Do I remember?” said Bill. “How could
I forget? You fellows had better be up pretty
early tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“You bet we will, Captain,” said Bob.</p>
<p>Then Hal said, “I guess I’d better be going.
My mother will be wondering if I’m
never coming home. I hope that I can come
with you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Hope you can come with us? Why, of
course you’re coming with us. We won’t go
without you,” Captain Bill said explosively.</p>
<p>“I’ll see,” said Hal. “I’ll ask Mother.
Maybe she’ll let me go. But anyway, I’ll
let you know. I’ll put up the flags in the
workshop window. All right?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” said Bob, and walked out with
Hal. He saw the boy to the door, and
warned him again to be sure to come.</p>
<p>When the two boys had left the room,
Captain Bill turned to his sister. “Say,” he
said, “do you think that Hal’s mother really
won’t let him come, or is the boy looking
for a way out?”</p>
<p>“Why, what do you mean?” asked Mrs.
Martin.</p>
<p>“Just this,” said Bill, and puffed vigorously
on his pipe. “I’ve been watching the
boy, and I think that he’s afraid.”</p>
<p>“Afraid of what?”</p>
<p>“Afraid of actually going up in an airplane.
I feel that a change has come over
him since there has been an actual chance
of his learning to fly,” explained the Captain.</p>
<p>His sister looked pensive. “But he’s always
been so interested in flying. That’s
all the two of them ever talk about.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. When there was no immediate
chance of his going up in a plane. Now that
there is, I think he’d like to back out.”</p>
<p>“There is his mother to consider, of
course,” said Mrs. Martin. “She would undoubtedly
object very strenuously if he
merely went to the airport. You must remember
that he’s all she has. She’s always
so careful of him.”</p>
<p>The Captain snorted. “Too careful,” he
said. “She’s made the boy a bundle of fears.
Bob has helped him get over some of them,
but I think that they’re cropping out now.
It will be very bad for Hal if he funks this.
I think that it will hurt him a great deal.
If he succeeds in overcoming his fears now
for once and for all, if he learns to go up
in a plane, even if he may never fly one
himself, he will be a new boy. He’ll never
be afraid again. But one let-down now, and
he will be set way back—even further back
than when Bob first met him.”</p>
<p>“I think you’re right, Bill,” said his
sister. “But what are we going to do about
it?”</p>
<p>The Captain shrugged his shoulders. “I
think the best thing to do with the boy is
not to let him know that we know he’s
afraid. Treat him just as if he were the
bravest lad in the world. I’ll take care
of that. But I can’t take care of his mother.
I never was a lady’s man,” smiled Captain
Bill. “You’ll have to attend to that.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin’s brow wrinkled. “I think
you’ve taken the easier task,” she said with
a wry smile. “I’d much rather teach a boy
to overcome his fears than teach a mother
to overcome hers. But I’ll try,” she added,
and hoped against hope for success.</p>
<p>Bob burst into the room. “How about
something to eat?” he said. “I’m starved!”</p>
<p>“As usual,” said his mother. “I would
like to hear you just once complain about
being not hungry.”</p>
<p>“All right, mother,” said Bob. “If you
want to hear me complain about that, you
just feed me a good dinner now, and I’ll do
my best to complain about being not hungry—after
I finish it.”</p>
<p>“You’re an impossible son,” said his mother,
but smiled fondly at him. She really
didn’t believe it.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">CHAPTER IV—Some War Heroes</a></h1>
<p>Whether secret springs were put into operation
by Mrs. Martin that afternoon or
not, nevertheless Hal was able to join the
party going to the airport early the next
morning. It was a beautiful morning. It
had stopped raining, and the sun, coming
out strong and bright, had dried everything
so thoroughly that only an occasional puddle
here and there on the road showed that
it had rained at all. The drive to the port
was pleasant, too; the port being about a
mile out of town, and at least five miles
from the Martin home.</p>
<p>When they arrived, the day’s program was
in full sway. A huge tri-motored plane was
loading passengers for a cross-country trip.
As the three approached the port, they saw
the great plane rise into the air and take off
exactly on schedule. Smaller planes were
flying about above the airport, and on the
ground mechanics were working over several
planes that needed overhauling. Captain Bill
wanted to go first to the administration
building, a large white brick structure, modern
as any office building in appearance. He
wanted to see the head of the airport, an
old friend of his, and make the final arrangements
for the care of his plane when
it came in.</p>
<p>As they were about to enter the building,
a tall, heavy-set man passed them, on his
way out. Captain Bill started, and half
turned. “Well, if that didn’t look like—”
he began, then turned and went on into the
building. “Looked like an old flying buddy
of mine. But of course, it couldn’t be. Old
Hank never was that fat. Never had an
ounce of fat on him. All skin and bone.
But you never can tell, eh, boys?”</p>
<p>“You’ll be getting there yourself, some
day, be careful,” laughed Bob.</p>
<p>John Headlund, delighted to see Captain
Bill, jumped up from his desk, and pumped
his hands up and own. “If it isn’t the
Captain! Man, it’s great to see you again!”
Headlund and Bill had flown together in
France, and although they had kept in touch
with each other a few years after they had
returned to America, the press of business
had kept them apart, and they had not seen
each other for years. Captain Bill presented
the boys.</p>
<p>“They’re going to bring new business for
you, Headlund,” said Bill. “Here are two
of America’s future flyers.”</p>
<p>The boys grinned.</p>
<p>Headlund, after wishing them success,
turned again to Bill. “Do you see any of
the old boys?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Pat McDermott’s my partner,” said Bill.
“He’s flying the old boat in this afternoon
sometime.”</p>
<p>“He is! That’s great! And quite a coincidence,
too. Do you know who was here—left just before you came in?”</p>
<p>“Not Hank Brown!” shouted Bill. “By
golly, I thought I recognized that face! Old
Hank! What was he doing here?”</p>
<p>“He’s got a ship down here in one of our
hangars. It’s a beauty—a four passenger
cabin plane, with the pilot’s seat up front—a
beautiful job. Listen, Hank’s gone down
to the hangar now to look it over. Maybe
you can catch him down there. It’s Avenue
B, the last hangar in line.”</p>
<p>“Great. I’d like to see Hank. Last time
I saw him he was in an English hospital,
eating porridge and not liking it at all. Who
would have thought that the old skinny
marink would have put on all that poundage?
Old Hank fat! And flying in a cabin
plane. Come on, fellows, we’ve got to go
down there and see him.” He turned to Headlund.
“I’m going to be in town all summer,
Heady, and I guess you’ll be seeing plenty
of me. What street did you say? Avenue
B?”</p>
<p>Captain Bill and the boys hurried out,
found the right road, and walked along it
until they came to the last hangar. A beautiful
plane, black and aluminum, stood outside.
But as they approached, there was nobody
to be seen.</p>
<p>“Ahoy, there!” shouted Bill. “Anybody
here know Hank Brown?”</p>
<p>Hank himself appeared from the other side
of the plane, where he had been conferring
with a mechanic. “I’m Henry Brown,” he
said, peering from behind gold-rimmed
glasses at Bill and the boys. His face registered
no sign of recognition at first. Then
suddenly it lighted up, he rushed forward,
and gripped Captain Bill’s hand in his, slapping
him heartily on the back with the other.
“Well, Bill! You old sock! Where
on earth did you come from? What are you
doing here? Where have you been?”</p>
<p>Bill, delighted to see his old buddy, laughed
at him, and poked him in his now well-padded
ribs. “One question at a time, Hank.
What are you doing here? And how come
you’ve got this grand ship?” asked Bill.</p>
<p>“I asked you first,” laughed Hank.</p>
<p>They spent the next ten minutes telling
each other just what they had been doing
since their last meeting. They spared the
details, but each was satisfied with the other’s
story. Hank had done well as the manager
and later as president of his father’s
steel plant. Prosperity had ironed out the
wrinkles that had always twinkled around
his steely grey eyes, and contentment had
added inches to his waistline, but he was
still the same generous, fun-loving Hank
that the boys had known in France.</p>
<p>“Listen,” said Hank. “Come on in and
try the plane. See how comfortable it is.
Say, this is some different from the old rattletraps
we used to fly, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“But we had some good thrills in them,
didn’t we,” said Bill. This meeting with
Hank was bringing back memories that had
not stirred in him for many years.</p>
<p>“Let’s get in here where we can talk in
comfort,” said Hank.</p>
<p>They mounted a little step that the mechanic
set for them, and entered the side door
of the plane. The inside was amazingly
luxurious. Along both sides were upholstered
seats, covered with multi-colored cushions.
There were built-in fixtures, and everything
to make for the greatest ease in traveling.
The pilot’s seat could be partitioned
off by a glass sliding door up front.</p>
<p>The three men sat down on the seats at
the side of the cabin. “Gee, they’re soft,”
said Bob. “I could ride all day on these.”
He jumped up and down a little.</p>
<p>“Remember your manners,” said Bill.</p>
<p>Bob stopped jumping and blushed. “Oh,
I forgot,” he said. He had really forgotten
that Hank Brown was an important man,
a millionaire. But Hank only laughed.</p>
<p>“How would you people like to take the
plane up on its last ride this year?” he asked.</p>
<p>“The last ride?” said Bill. “Why the
last?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m putting her away,” said Hank.
“That’s what I was talking to the mechanic
and Headlund about. I was going to spend
my summer up in my log cabin in Canada,
fishing, and all that. But my wife wants
to go to Europe instead. She’s going to
take the two girls over to France and leave
them there in school. That would mean
she’d have to come back all alone. I’ve been
intending to go back to take a look around
ever since I’ve been back in America, so I
thought I’d take the opportunity of getting
over there now with her. I wouldn’t take
the plane. I won’t need a big ship like this.
If I want to fly I can pick up a little French
or German bus. So I’m putting old Lizzie
in the hangar. Seems a shame. But how
would you like to go up now? Would you
like to try her out?” he asked Bill.
“Would I?” said Bill. He slid into the
pilot’s seat, and looked over the instrument
board, to familiarize himself with the instruments
with which the plane was equipped.
Then he turned back to the boys. “Want
to go up?”</p>
<p>Bob was almost beside himself with excitement.
“Take her up, Bill go on,” he
squealed. “Sure we want to go up. Go
ahead, Bill.”</p>
<p>Hal said nothing. His face was pale. Bill
thought that it would be best to ignore him,
and just take it for granted that he wanted
to go up, too. And Hal, although he was
by this time frightened to death, would not
admit it. He decided to risk the going up
rather than say that he was afraid.</p>
<p>The mechanic taxied the plane out into
the open and took away the steps. Bill
pressed the starter, and the great propeller
began to move. Slowly the ship rolled over
the ground, gradually gaming momentum.
Finally it rose into the air. Bill handled
the huge ship as though it were a toy. Higher
and higher it rose. Bob, looking out of
the window, saw the building of the airport
whizzing by below them, then
disappear into a whirling mass. Were they going?
Were they standing still? Bob couldn’t
tell.</p>
<p>“How high are we?” he shouted at the
top of his voice to Hank.</p>
<p>“About 5,000 feet,” judged Hank. He
was looking over at Hal rather anxiously.
He thought that maybe the boy was going
to be sick. But Hal manfully hung on,
and said nothing.</p>
<p>“We seem to be standing still,” shouted
Bob.</p>
<p>“We’re going, all right. Your uncle is
a great one for speed!” shouted back Hank.</p>
<p>The plane was banking now for a turn.
They were going back. In a short while
Bill had brought the plane down once more
into the airport.</p>
<p>“Well, how did you like it?” he said,
turning around in his pilot’s seat.</p>
<p>“Great!” said Bob.</p>
<p>But Hal was just a little sick. He said
nothing, and waited for the world to settle
down again.</p>
<p>“You sure handle the ship like you used
to in the old days,” said Hank admiringly
to Bill.</p>
<p>“She’s a great ship,” said Bill, modestly.</p>
<p>Hank had an idea. “Say,” he said impulsively,
“how would you like to fly her
while I’m in Europe?”</p>
<p>“Gee, Hank, I really don’t think”—began
Bill. He thought, the same old Hank, always
generous, always impulsive.</p>
<p>But Hank was going on with his plan.
“Listen, I won’t take ‘no’ for an answer.
You fly my plane. And you can fly it up
to the Canadian cabin if you want to. Then
a perfectly swell vacation plan won’t be entirely
thrown away. How about it? The
cabin is all ready to move into. They’ve
been fixing it up for me. What do you say?
Are you game?”</p>
<p>“Game?” said Bill. “Gee, I’m crazy about
the idea. But I don’t see why you should
do this for me.”</p>
<p>Hank was embarrassed. “You’ve been
pretty decent to me in other times, remember
that, Bill, old boy,” he said.</p>
<p>“Forget it,” said Bill.</p>
<p>Hank turned to the boys. “Bill here shot
down a Boche when the Boche was all but
stepping on my tail. Those were the days,
eh, Bill?”</p>
<p>“You bet,” said Bill. “We sure were
glad to get back alive. Remember old Lufbery?
Raoul of the Lafayette Escadrille?
There was a boy who could shoot them
down. Six out of seven in one day. Not
bad flying, that. They used to get pretty
close to Raoul themselves. He’d come in
with his clothes ripped with bullets, but
ready to go right out again with the next
patrol. Then one day he got his, and there
wasn’t a man there that wouldn’t have given
everything he had to save him, either.
He’d gone up after a German that nobody
seemed able to down. Lufbery climbed up
to get above him, and dove. But something
went wrong with his plane—God knows
what, and those who were watching from
the ground saw it burst into flame. Then
they saw him stand on the edge of the cockpit
and jump. It was horrible. But it was
the only way for Lufbery to die—with his
plane. He wanted it that way.”</p>
<p>Then Hank said, “And Bill Thaw! There
was another flying fool. Bill was great fun—always
laughing and joking, just as if his
next flight might not be his last. Remember
what he did to those three German planes
when they got fresh with him, Bill?” He
turned to the boys. “Thaw,” he explained,
“was coming back from his regular patrol,
when he suddenly came face to face with
three German planes. One of them maneuvered
to his left, the second to his right, and
the third dove below him to fire up. Well,
Bill had to think fast, and he did. He side-slipped
until he was directly over the plane
below him, and fired down. One gone.
Then he pulled himself out of a steep dive,
and went after the second plane. A quick
swoop, and a steep bank, a rapid burst of
fire, and the second German went down in a
burning nose dive.</p>
<p>“From then on it was nip and tuck, and
each man for himself, dog eat dog. It was
a pretty even battle. The German was plucky,
and ripped into Thaw for all he was worth.
But one lucky turn, one accurate shot, and
Thaw had him. Down went his plane.
Thaw, his plane in ribbons, his clothes bullet-riddled,
limped home, stepped out of his
plane with a smile, and a joke on his lips.”</p>
<p>“Golly,” said Bob, “that must have been
great fun. I wish I’d been there.”</p>
<p>“What would we have done with a baby
in swaddling clothes?” laughed Bill.</p>
<p>“Aw,” said Bob, “you know I mean if
I was old enough.”</p>
<p>Hank was looking into the distance, with
the far-away look that meant another story
was coming on, and Bob stopped talking.</p>
<p>Finally Hank said, “Remember Luke and
Wehner? What a team! You never saw
two men so different in your life. Frank
Luke talked a lot—not always the most
modest fellow in the world, either, and made
a great to-do about everything he did. But
he sure did plenty of damage to the Germans.
Joe Wehner was quiet, modest, never
talked very much, and never about himself.
But still they were always together. Came
to be known as ‘The Luke and Wehner
Duo.’</p>
<p>“They worked together, too. Went out
on the same patrol and always stuck together.
Luke’s specialty was shooting down
Drachens. Those were the German observation
balloons that they sent up behind
their lines to observe what was going on
in the American lines. Of course, the information
they got caused plenty of harm,
and anybody who shot down a Drachen
was doing a lot of good. But the things
were expensive and useful, and the Germans
sent them up with plenty of protection.
There was always a swarm of planes flying
around them and ready to light into any
stranger that came near.</p>
<p>“Luke and Wehner used to take care of
that. Wehner would fly above Luke, looking
out for any plane that might come to
attack him. If one hove in sight, Wehner
would go for him and engage him while
Luke flew on and shot down the balloon.
Balloon after balloon went down. The Germans
were getting wary.</p>
<p>“One day when Luke and Wehner were
on their way to see what they could do
about three Drachens that were watching
the American lines, they met up with a formation
of Fokkers. Wehner dived into the
uneven battle. Luke flew on, and shot down
one, then the other bag. But the gallant
Wehner had fought his last fight. One of
the Fokkers downed him. Luke, who saw
what had happened to his pal, left the remaining
balloon and furiously charged the
Fokkers. He fought like mad, zooming,
diving, spurting fire into those German planes.
Two of them hurtled to the ground. The
others fled. Luke started for home. On
his way he engaged and downed another
enemy plane. It was a record that on any
other day he would have boasted about.
But not that day. His pal had been killed,
and Luke was for once silent and speechless.</p>
<p>“Of course, he didn’t give up balloon
breaking. He added up a goodly store. But
one day he got his, like so many of them.
He’d sent three Drachens down in flames that
day, when his own plane was so badly crippled,
and he was so badly wounded that he
was forced to land. He wouldn’t let them
take him, though, and he died fighting. When
a band of German soldiers approached him,
he pulled out his gun and shot six of them
before he fell dead.”</p>
<p>It was Bill’s turn. “Of course you boys
have heard of Eddie Rickenbacker. There
was an ace for you. If it was speed and
trick flying that you wanted, Eddie was the
man to give it to you. He had a bag of
tricks that would get any pursuit plane off
his tail. But he didn’t always use them.
He didn’t have 26 planes to his credit for
nothing. Eddie was a great ace and a great
scout.”</p>
<p>Hank interrupted. “Here we go gassing
again like two old fogies. I feel like my
own grandfather sitting on the front porch
and discussing the battle of Bull Run. We
are getting old, aren’t we, Bill? These
youngsters ought to be glad that they didn’t
have to fly those old buses that we used,
though. The new planes are great to fly.
You two are going to have a grand time.
I’d rather fly than travel any other way.
But I don’t think that it would be quite
the thing to suggest to my wife now that
I would rather fly to Europe with her than
take the boat. So old Hank will be a land
animal this time. Or rather, a water animal,
instead of a bird.”</p>
<p>“A sort of—fish?” laughed Bill.</p>
<p>“Shut up, you,” said Hank. “Now, listen,
how about that offer of my cabin and
my plane for your vacation? It’ll be a
grand trip, and I guarantee that you’ll like
the cabin on the mountain. Nobody around
for miles, except Jake, who takes care of
the place for me. In fact, there’s no town
for a hundred miles around. About the only
practical way of getting there is by plane.
Just think, old man, all of that beauty and
solitude going begging. You can get right
back to nature there, live a wild life, or
have all the conveniences of home, whichever
you chose. We’ve got the place all fixed
up. It’s a real man’s place, and you’ll love
it. And I’d like to see somebody who’d appreciate
it have it this summer. And I know
you would.”</p>
<p>Bill looked at Hank, who was talking so
earnestly, with a puzzled look. “Listen,
Hank,” he said, “you aren’t trying to persuade
me to go up there as a favor to you,
are you? Because if you are, you’re crazy.
It’s certainly not you who should be doing
the begging. We ought to be down on our
hands and knees begging you for the place.
The only reason I hesitate at all is because
I think it’s too much you’re doing for us.”</p>
<p>Hank snorted. “Then you’re going to
take the place.”</p>
<p>Bill looked at him fondly, seeing through
the strange marks that time had left on this
man, the young, awkward boy whom he
had befriended in France, when he had
been just a young fellow himself, but not
so green as the other. Then he said, “What
do you say we leave it up to the boys?” He
turned to them. “What do you say, Bob?
How does a vacation up in the mountains
sound to you?”</p>
<p>Bob, his eyes shining, could hardly answer.
He hadn’t wanted to show too much eagerness
before because he had remembered his
manners just in time, and was watching Bill
to see how they should respond to Hank
Brown’s generous offer. But now that he
saw that Bill was favorably disposed, he
breathed, “Oh, gee, I think that it would be
great! Just great! Let’s go, Bill.”</p>
<p>Hank was amused and pleased by this
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The Captain turned to Hal. “How about
you?”</p>
<p>Hal, who had forgotten his misery during
the recital of the exciting stories of war
aces, and was once more fired with ambition,
now that he was safely on the ground, was
almost as enthusiastic. “But,” he said as
an afterthought, “I don’t know whether I
could go, of course. My mother—” his
voice trailed off.</p>
<p>Bill reached over and grasped Hank’s hand.
“We’ll take it, old scout. Don’t know how
to thank you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t,” said Hank. “I’m glad you’re
going to go. All you have to do is to wire
to Jake when you’re coming. He lights bonfires
to mark the landing field, and there
you are. I’m going to be in town for two
weeks, so you can come up any time to
make arrangements. O.K.? Now I’ve got
to go. I’ve been spending too much time
as it is. Wish I could stay and see Pat, but
I can’t. Tell him to come up and see me,
will you?”</p>
<p>He bid them goodbye and left in his automobile
which had been parked nearby.
The next hour was spent in an exciting
inspection of the various planes in the airport,
from tiny two-seater monoplanes that
looked like fragile toys, to huge biplanes;
and in a growing impatience with Pat’s delay.
Finally a tiny speck appeared on the
horizon, but the three of them had been
disappointed so often that they did not dare
to hope that this was at last Pat McDermott.
But it was. He stepped out of the green
monoplane and pushing up his goggles, looked
around him. He spied his three friends
immediately, and hurried to meet them.</p>
<p>“Hi, Irish!” called Captain Bill. “I want
you to meet two pals of mine.” He introduced
Bob and Hal. “We’re going to teach
them to fly.”</p>
<p>The two boys shook hands with Pat. He
looked like his name, a tall, broad, husky
man with a shock of curly hair that had
probably once been red, but which was now
brown, with a little gray at the temples; a
young face—it was impossible to tell how
old he was; and a broad grin that spread
across his face and up around his eyes, disappearing
into the roots of his hair.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, without ceremony, as
though he had been friends of theirs for
years, “They’ll make good flyers if they’re
not too lazy. And if anybody can make
you work, I can. And I will.”</p>
<p>The Captain laughed. “Don’t take Pat
seriously,” he said. “He’s too lazy to make
you work very hard. But let me warn you
that he’s trained army flyers, so you’d better
not mind what he says, while he’s teaching
you.”</p>
<p>The boys had gone over and were looking
at the Marianne. She was a beautifully
stream-lined craft, large yet graceful.</p>
<p>Pat noticed the boys’ admiration, and was
pleased. “How about taking a ride in her
now?” he asked.</p>
<p>“They just got down to earth,” said the
Captain. He explained about Hank and
Hank’s plane. Pat was delighted that their
old pal had turned up, and decided that
they would have to have a reunion very
soon. He also decided on the spot that
he was going along with them to the mountains.</p>
<p>“Try to keep me away. Although I don’t
much fancy the riding on cushions, in a fancy
plane. When I fly, I want to fly. But
if you let me do the piloting, I’ll make the
best of that.” Pat always decided things
that way, but nobody resented his high-hand
manner, since he looked, and was, the sort
of man who could make good on any job
he undertook. “Well, Bob, my lad,” he
said, turning to the boy, “how about going
up? It’s the first step in learning to fly.
And don’t think that it’s going to be like
cabin flying. You’ll notice the difference
when you get up. Ready?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” said Bob.</p>
<p>Pat produced a helmet and some goggles.
“It’s an open cockpit you’re sitting in,” he
said. “And see that the goggles fit tightly.”</p>
<p>Bob wiggled them around. “They seem
all right,” he said.</p>
<p>“All right, hop in,” Pat told him.</p>
<p>Bob climbed into the rear cockpit, no
less thrilled by his second flight that day
than he had been by his first. He waved his
hand to the Captain and Hal who were
watching them. Pat climbed into the front
cockpit. “Ready?” he called.</p>
<p>“O. K!” shouted Bob.</p>
<p>Pat started the motor, which was a self-starter.
The plane taxied gently across the
field, and Pat turned her nose into the wind.
Bob felt her lift from the earth; there was
a bump—they hadn’t quite cleared; Pat
speeded up, until Bob, looking over the side
of the cockpit, could see the ground slipping
by dizzily. Then the bumping stopped;
they had left the ground. This time they
did not again bump; the Marianne soared into
the air.</p>
<p>Bob could feel the blast of air against
his face, and he was glad his goggles fitted
well. The motor roared, the wind screamed.
Bob tried to shout, but could not hear himself
uttering a sound. He looked down.
The airport looked as it had from the other
plane. Now he had more of the feeling of
flying. There was a sudden bump. The
Marianne dropped suddenly. Bob felt as
though he were in an elevator that had descended
very suddenly—there was the same
pit-of-the-stomach feeling. Air bump, he
thought, and it was. He looked over the side
again, and could see nothing. They were
traveling pretty high.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the roar of the motor stopped,
and they began to descend at what Bob
felt must be an almost unbelievable speed.
At first Bob was frightened, but then realized
that they were gliding down. Every
now and then Pat turned on his engine
again. Bob, looking over the side, could
see the fields coming up to meet them. They
landed so gently that he hardly felt the jolt
of the wheels touching the ground.</p>
<p>How funny to stand on the stable ground
once more! The sound of the motor was
still roaring in Bob’s ears. He pulled off
the goggles and helmet. “It was marvelous!”
he shouted loudly to his friends.</p>
<p>“We can hear you,” said the Captain.
“You needn’t shout!”</p>
<p>“Was I shouting?” laughed Bob.</p>
<p>“You are,” said the Captain.</p>
<p>But Pat had turned to Hal. “Well, lad,
you’re next.”</p>
<p>But Hal said what he had been rehearsing
for many minutes, in fact, ever since Bob
had taken to the air. “Don’t you think
it’s rather late? We haven’t had any lunch.
Maybe we could go up again after lunch.”</p>
<p>Captain Bill, who knew the struggle that
was going on in Hal’s heart, and who was
getting hungry anyway, said, “Lunch.
That’s the idea. We’ve got a great picnic
lunch, Pat.”</p>
<p>“Lead me to it,” said Pat.</p>
<p>“Knew that would get you,” laughed the
Captain.</p>
<p>They left the plane in charge of a mechanic,
who was to look after it, and went over
to the automobile that the Captain had
parked. They decided, on Bob’s suggestion,
to eat on a grassy slope from which they
could see the airport.</p>
<p>“I’ve got an idea,” said the Captain. “You
can start your story about Lindbergh.”</p>
<p>“I’m ready,” said Bob, “if you’re ready
to listen. I think I know the story backwards
and forward.”</p>
<p>“Begin at the beginning, always,” the
Captain warned.</p>
<p>They reached the spot where they had
chosen to picnic, and settled back contentedly
in the long grass to hear part of Bob’s story
before lunch.</p>

<div class="section" id="chapter-vthe-eagle">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">CHAPTER V—The Eagle</a></h1>
<p>“Well,” began Bob, “I guess my story
isn’t going to be very new to any of you.
Gee, I know it almost by heart, and I suppose
everybody else does, too.”</p>
<p>“Don’t apologize,” said the Captain.
“We’ll be only too glad to stop you if we’ve
heard it before. I don’t think that we will,
though. It’s a story that bears repeating.”</p>
<p>Bob’s eyes lighted up. “You bet,” he
said. “I never get tired of reading about it.”
He plucked at the grass beside him. “Gee,
it makes a fellow want to do things. It
makes him feel that the older folks don’t
know everything—”</p>
<p>“A-hem,” interrupted Captain Bill.</p>
<p>Bob laughed. “You’re not old folks, old
bean. Don’t flatter yourself. Anyway,
they told Lindbergh that he couldn’t do it.
They told him that his plane was carrying
too much, and he’d never be able to make
it alone.”</p>
<p>“Did he?” said Pat.</p>
<p>Bob looked at him disgustedly. “Did he!
Don’t make fun of me, you old Irishman!”</p>
<p>The old Irishman looked grieved. “Well,
I just wanted to know. I’m always willing
to learn somethin’ new. And you’d better
get started, or we’ll never know. We’ll be
leaving the lad up in the air, so to speak.”</p>
<p>“Ignore that ape,” said Captain Bill, “and
proceed.”</p>
<p>“Lindbergh didn’t listen to them. He just
went ahead and did what he thought was
right, and by golly, he was right. It makes
a fellow feel that even if he is young he
can do things. He doesn’t just have to sit
around and do what everybody else has done
before. There’s got to be a first every time.
Lindy wasn’t afraid just because nobody
had ever flown the Atlantic alone before, and
the wiseacres said that it couldn’t be done.
He just went ahead and flew it.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t as easy as all that,” quietly
remarked Hal.</p>
<p>Bob turned to him. “Of course not.
Lindy had planned every move that he was
going to make. He was prepared for anything.
That’s why he’s always so successful.
He has his plans all laid before he ever
takes off. He’s got all the courage in the
world, but he’s not reckless.”</p>
<p>“Put that under your hat, my lad. It’s
a good lesson to know by heart when you’re
going into the flying game.”</p>
<p>“You bet,” said Bob. “Gee, it needed
a lot of courage for him to make that take-off.
I’ve got the date down here. It was
May 20, 1927, on a Friday. That must
have been an exciting morning down at
Roosevelt Field. He made up his mind on
Thursday afternoon. They told him that
the weather was all right over the North
Atlantic, and that it would be best if he
started out the next morning.</p>
<p>“He didn’t tell anybody about his plans.
He never talks very much anyway. Everybody
found that out later. It was all sort
of secret. He just told his mechanics to get
the Spirit of St. Louis ready, and keep their
mouths shut. I guess he didn’t want everybody
messing around with his plans. But
the men who delivered his gasoline weren’t
so secret, I guess, and somehow his plans
leaked out Thursday night.</p>
<p>“That Thursday night was pretty awful.
It was raining, and the weather could be cut
with a knife. But once people found out
that Slim was going to start, they began
to come around to Curtiss Field, and at two
o’clock in the morning there was a big crowd
of them standing around in the rain and
mud. Slim wasn’t leaving from Curtiss,
though, and they towed his plane by truck
over to Roosevelt. They got there just
about when it was getting light.</p>
<p>“There was a crowd over at Curtiss, too.
But Slim didn’t care. Crowds never mean
much to him. He saw a whole lot more
of them later on, too, but he never was one
to strut or show off. He just got into his
fur-lined suit, and waited for the men to
start his engine. Somebody asked him if he
had only five sandwiches and two canteens
of water. ‘Sure,’ he said. ‘If I get to Paris,
I won’t need any more, and if I don’t get
there, I won’t need any more, either.’ It
was just like him to say that, but the real
reason he didn’t take any more was because
he had too much weight already. He had
over 200 gallons of gas, and the load was
heavy. He had to cut down on everything
that wasn’t absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>“Well, they started his motor for him.
The plane was standing on the Roosevelt
runway, which is pretty smooth, and five
thousand feet long. The weather had cleared
up a little. And there was the monoplane
looking all silver and slick, roaring away for
all it was worth. Lindy said goodbye to
his mother, and to Byrd and Chamberlin
and Acosta, who were planning their own
trips across the Atlantic, and then he stepped
into the cockpit, and closed the door.</p>
<p>“He raced his motor a little bit. She must
have sounded pretty sweet to him, because
he gave her the gun, and off he went. That
start must have been one of the hardest
parts of the whole trip. The Spirit of St.
Louis bumped along that muddy runway,
and the people watching thought she’d go
over on her nose any moment. She was
over-loaded. Her motor was pulling for all
she was worth, but it didn’t seem as though
they’d ever make it. She went off the
ground a few feet, and bounced down again.
But then the crowd held its breath. She was
leaving the ground. They were up about
fifteen feet. And there were telegraph wires
in their path. If they hit those, the trip
to Paris was over right then. But they
didn’t. The landing gear cleared by a few
inches. That crowd simply roared. But
Slim didn’t hear them. He was on his way
to Paris.”</p>
<p>Bob paused for breath. He had been talking
very fast, carried away by his story.
The others did not speak, but sat waiting
for him to go on. They had all heard the
story before, but as the Captain had said,
it bore repeating, and they could hear it
again and again. There was something agelessly
appealing in the tale of that young
man’s feat.</p>
<p>Bob was talking again. “I’m not much
at poetry,” he said.</p>
<p>“You bet you’re not,” said Captain Bill.
“I’ve read some of yours.”</p>
<p>Bob glared at him. “I never wrote a
poem!” he said defensively.</p>
<p>The Captain looked contrite. “It must
have been Hal,” he said. “I beg your pardon.
Go on with your story. Where does
the poetry come in?”</p>
<p>“I was going to tell you, before you interrupted,
so rudely, that there’s somebody
who’s written a poem—a lot of poetry, to
music—a cantata I think they call it. It’s
about Lindy’s flight, and it tells the story
of the flight across the Atlantic. I guess
it’s pretty thrilling. Maybe that’s the only
way the story can be told—in poetry and
music, because it always sounds pretty flat
when you just say Lindy flew across the
Atlantic in a monoplane. It needs music,
with a lot of trumpets—”</p>
<p>“Go on, go on, my lad. More words, less
music.” Pat seemed to be getting impatient.
The sun was pretty high over their heads
now, and bees were buzzing drowsily in the
tall grass all around them. Hal had stretched
out on his stomach, facing the little group,
which was seated now in a semi-circle. “I’ll
be falling asleep if you don’t get on.”</p>
<p>Bob laughed embarrassedly. “All right,
you just stop me if I get to rambling. You
keep me straight, Irish.”</p>
<p>Captain Bill leaned back on a hummock
of earth, his arms folded behind his head.
“I’m so comfortable, I could listen to anything,
even to Bob telling a story. Go on,
Bob.”</p>
<p>“One more crack, and you don’t hear
anything,” said Bob. “Remember the rules,
no interruptions from the gallery.”</p>
<p>“We stand corrected. Go on.”</p>
<p>Bob settled himself once again into the
grass. “Well, we’ve got Lindy into the air.
No sooner had he set out when people began
reporting that they’d seen him. Some
of them had. A lot of them were just excited
individuals who’d heard a motorcycle
back-firing. But somebody actually did see
him flying over Rhode Island, and about
two hours, nearly, after he had set out, they
flashed back that he’d been seen at Halifax,
Massachusetts. Then he dropped out of
sight. Nobody reported seeing him. That
was because he took an over-water route, and
was out some distance, flying along the coast
of New England.</p>
<p>“They saw him next over Nova Scotia,
running along nicely, and then Springfield,
Nova Scotia saw him. It was about one
o’clock, and he was going strong. But he
was getting into a dangerous region, cold and
foggy. They had watchers looking for him
everywhere. Lindy left Nova Scotia at Cape
Breton, headed for Newfoundland. It was
pretty stiff going, about 200 miles without
sight of land, and over a pretty treacherous
sea. But at 7:15 they saw him flying low
over St. John’s, in Newfoundland. They
could see the number on the wings, and sent
back word to the world that he had passed
there. And that was the last word that anybody
received that Friday.</p>
<p>“The going had been pretty good until
then. The weather was clear, and the ceiling
pretty high. But as soon as it got dark,
Lindy and his plane hit some pretty bad
weather. It grew mighty cold, and a thick
swirling fog came up and swallowed up the
plane. This was mighty tough, because if
he flew low, he was bound to run into one
of the icebergs that were floating in the icy
sea. So he climbed up to about 10,000 feet,
and stayed there. Flying high was all right,
but it added another danger. Ice was forming
on the wings of the Spirit of St. Louis, and
if it got thick enough, it would break off
a wing of the plane, and send the plane and
Lindy into the sea.</p>
<p>“Lindy could have turned back, but he
didn’t. He kept right on, through fog and
sleet and rain. His motor never missed. It
was a good pal, and no wonder he included
it in his feat, and said later that ‘we crossed
the Atlantic.’</p>
<p>“When morning came, a whole flock of
cables came, too. It seems a whole lot of
ships had sighted Lindy’s plane, or somebody’s
plane, anywhere from 500 to 100
miles off the coast of Ireland, where he was
headed. Nobody knew who to believe, but
at 10:00 o’clock came the real news, that
he was over a place called Valencia, Ireland.</p>
<p>“Lindy wondered where he was, himself.
Flying blind as he had, he didn’t know just
where he had come out. So he decided to
ask the first person he met. Now you can
imagine the air roads weren’t full of planes
flying to Ireland, and Lindy had to wait
until he sighted a fishing schooner. He
swooped low and shouted out, ‘Am I headed
for Ireland?’ The fishermen were so astounded
that they couldn’t answer, so Lindy
flew on his course, depending as he had all
night, on his compass. Pretty soon he came
in sight of land, and knew that it was Ireland.”</p>
<p>“Because it was so beautiful,” said Pat.</p>
<p>“No, because it was rocky, and his maps
indicated that the land would be rocky,”
said Bob.</p>
<p>“Oh, no doubt he could tell it was Ireland,”
insisted Pat. “His mother was Irish,
you know, and it needs mighty little Irish
blood to make a man long for the ould sod.”</p>
<p>“Well, anyway, there he was over Ireland,”
put in Bob, pointedly. “And from
Ireland, on to England, and from England,
on to France. Along the Seine, and then
Paris. They were waiting for him at Le
Bourget, and sent up flares and rockets, long
before he got there. Maybe they weren’t excited
when he flew into range! It was about
8:30, that is, French time, but about 5:30
New York time, when Lindy and the Spirit
of St. Louis circled around the landing field
at Le Bourget and landed. Golly, I wish
I’d been there. The first man in the world
to fly the Atlantic, landing before my very
eyes! He’d gone 3,640 miles, and had made
it in 33½ hours. Some going!</p>
<p>“Well, he was there. And he got out of
the plane. And you all know what he said
when he got out. I—”</p>
<p>“I am Charles Lindbergh,” said Captain
Bill and Pat, not quite in unison.</p>
<p>“Yup,” said Bob, “‘I am Charles Lindbergh.’
He thought that they wouldn’t know
who he was. He’d been flying pretty low
over Ireland and England, and so far as
he could see, nobody had paid much attention
to him. So he introduced himself,
just as though every man, woman and child
in every civilized country wasn’t saying that
very name all through the day. Remember
when we heard the news over the radio,
Hal? We were so excited we nearly upset
the furniture. Golly, that was a day.</p>
<p>“Well, that was Slim Lindbergh’s flight,
and now about Slim himself. He was born
in Detroit, Michigan, on February 2, 1902,
and that means that he was only twenty-five
years old when he made his greatest
flight, which is pretty young to become the
most famous man in the world.</p>
<p>“His dad was Charles A. Lindbergh, and
he died in 1924, when he was running for
governor of Minnesota on the Farmer-Labor
ticket. He’d been a Representative in Congress
before. Lindy and he were great pals,
and played around together a lot. Lindy’s
mother was Irish, and taught school in Detroit.</p>
<p>“Lindy went to school in Little Falls, and
to Little Falls High School. He graduated
from there when he was 16. He was good
in Math and in other things he liked, but
not in grammar.</p>
<p>“Lindy didn’t go right to college. In fact,
he didn’t go until three years after he’d graduated
from high school, and then he went to
the University of Wisconsin, to take up
mechanical engineering. He was good at
that. He’d always liked to tinker, and he
got his chance there. He did at college just
what you’d expect him to do. He had some
friends and acquaintances, but mostly he
kept to himself. He was the same quiet, shy
person that everybody got to know later,
when he became famous.</p>
<p>“Slim didn’t stay at Wisconsin very long,
so we don’t know what he would have finally
done there. He went over to Lincoln,
Nebraska, where they had a flying school,
and asked them to teach him to fly. They
taught him the beginnings of flying, and
from the moment his hands touched the controls,
he knew that this was what he was
cut out for. He just took naturally to
those levers and gadgets, and could handle
his plane like a toy.</p>
<p>“It seems that Lindy was born to be a
pilot. He’s built for one, in the first place.
Long and rangy, and slim. No extra weight,
but plenty of muscle and endurance. He’s
got a lot of nerve and never gets excited
He showed that when he got himself elected
to the Caterpillar Club. But I’ll get to that
later.” Here Bob paused, and looked up at
the sun, which was just slipping a little
westward. “Say,” he said. “Would you
folks mind if I continued my story later?
I feel just a little empty. How about the
food?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking that for a long time,”
said the Captain. “But rules are rules. I
didn’t want to interrupt you.”</p>
<p>Bob snorted. “Say, for food you can interrupt
me any time. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>He jumped up, stretched himself, and
made for the car, to get out the huge hamper
of lunch. “Say,” he called back, “Lindy
may have been satisfied with five sandwiches
all the way to Paris, but darned if I couldn’t
eat five right now.” He carried the hamper
over to the knoll where the others were.
They were all standing now, limbering up,
stretching, sniffing the good air, and looking
eagerly toward the food.</p>
<p>“Here, lend a hand,” said Bob. He plumped
down the basket so that they could hear
the rattle of forks and tin cups within, and
sat down beside it.</p>
<p>“You’re the host,” said Hal, seating himself
comfortably on the grass and looking
on. “It’s your party. We have to listen
to your story, so the least you can do is
feed us.”</p>
<p>Bob had opened the hamper, and was viewing
its contents eagerly. He dived into the
basket. “Say, anybody who doesn’t help
himself, doesn’t eat. Fall to.”</p>
<p>They fell to, doing much eating but little
talking. Finally Bob sat back, a sandwich
in one hand, a cup of steaming coffee
out of the thermos bottle in the other. “I
have a suspicion,” he said, “that you don’t
like my story.”</p>
<p>“Don’t get ideas like that, Bob, my lad,”
said Pat. “We love your story. We just
like sandwiches better.”</p>
<p>“All right, then I won’t finish,” said Bob.
“I’m going to be independent.”</p>
<p>Hal looked up. “Not finish? You’ve got
finish any story you start.”</p>
<p>“One of the rules? There aren’t any rules.
You just made that up.”</p>
<p>Hal was cajoling now. “Aw, come on,
Bob. We want to hear the end. Come on,
tell us the rest.”</p>
<p>Bob bit into a huge slice of cake. He
shook his head. “Nope, no end.”</p>
<p>“Well, at least about the Caterpillar Club.
At least you’ll tell us how Lindy saved his
life by bailing out. We’ve got to hear that.”</p>
<p>But Bob was adamant. “I’ve been insulted.
I’m not going on. Anyway, Lindy
didn’t save his life once by bailing out of
a plane.”</p>
<p>“He didn’t? You said a little while ago
that he did.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say once. He became eligible
to the Caterpillar Club four times.”</p>
<p>Hal looked at Bob with disgust. “I must
say that you’re being very disagreeable.”</p>
<p>Captain Bill, who had been looking on in
amusement, suddenly laughed very loudly.
“Don’t coax him, Hal. He doesn’t need
coaxing. He’s going to tell the rest of the
story, don’t you worry. Wild horses couldn’t
keep him from finishing the tale. Could
they, Bob, old man?”</p>
<p>Bob looked over at his uncle and grinned.
“Why, you old sinner. What a way to
talk about your favorite nephew. But now
that you mention it, maybe I did intend to
finish the story, seeing that I’d started it.
Now, where was I?”</p>
<p>Pat was clearing up the debris made by
four men eating a picnic lunch. “You’ve
got Lindbergh at the Nebraska flying school
for a long time.”</p>
<p>“Oh, not very long,” said Bob. “You see,
he stayed there really a short time. In fact,
he never did any solo flying there.”</p>
<p>“Well, why not?” asked Hal.</p>
<p>“They asked for a five-hundred dollar
bond from every student before he went up
on his first solo flight. This seemed silly to
Lindy, and he left the school.</p>
<p>“When he left, he did what so many of
the flyers were doing then. He went out
west, and did stunting, risking his neck at
county fairs and air circuses to give the people
a thrill. He did, too. He handled his
plane like a toy, doing rolls, tail spins, and
every kind of stunt imaginable. But the
most exciting thing that he did, and it usually
isn’t an exciting thing at all, was landing
his plane. He could land on a dime, and
as lightly as a feather. That’s really piloting,
isn’t it, Bill?”</p>
<p>“You bet,” said the Captain. He was
sprawled out on his back, enjoying his after
dinner rest. “A landing will show you your
flyer’s ability every time. Provided, of course,
that he has a fairly decent landing field. Did
I ever tell you the story that Hawks tells
in his autobiography? Do you mind if I
interrupt for just a minute, Bob?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, go right ahead,” said Bob, witheringly.
“Go right ahead. I was just telling
a story.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said Captain Bill with a grin.
“I will. Well, it seems that Hawks was
stunting down in Mexico, and doing quite
a bit of private flying. He got a commission
to fly a Congressman and a General,
I think it was, back to their home town of
Huatemo. Have you ever heard of Huatemo?
I thought not. Well, Huatemo had
never seen an airplane close up, and the two
high muckamucks decided that they’d give
the natives a thrill by coming back via plane.
Hawks had them wire ahead to have a landing
field prepared. The native officials wired
that they had a fine field, clear of all obstructions,
but dotted with a few small trees.
‘Fine, says Hawks, but have them remove
the trees immediately.’ The natives said that
this had been done, and the party started out.</p>
<p>“After several adventures, Hawks flew
over Huatemo, and prepared to spiral down
to the landing field. Imagine his chagrin
and surprise, my dear boys, when he discovered,
that the officials of Huatemo had indeed
cut down the Huateman trees, but had left
the stumps standing!”</p>
<p>“Whew,” said Bob. “What did he do,
turn around?”</p>
<p>“No, he couldn’t. And anyway, there
was no other place to land. The field was
surrounded by dense forests. He had to
make it. He brought his plane down without
hitting a stump, and then zig-zagged
wildly from stump to stump like a croquet
ball trying to miss wickets. And he missed
them all, too, except one. The wheel hit it
an awful smack, and collapsed. The plane
tilted up on its nose, and came to rest with
its propeller in the ground and its tail waving
gayly in the air, not at all like a proper
plane should.”</p>
<p>“And killed them all,” said Pat.</p>
<p>“Who, Hawks? Not on your life. He’s
a lucky fellow. Not one of them was hurt.
They climbed out of the plane, and were
greeted by the natives, joyously and with
acclaim. And not one of the natives seemed
to suspect in the least that this wasn’t the
way a plane should land. Or at least the
way a crazy American would land a plane.”
The Captain finished his story, and paused.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Bob grudgingly, “that was
a good story, too. But, as I was saying,
Lindy was a good stunter, and a good flyer.
He decided that he wanted a plane of his
own. He heard that there was going to be
a sale of army planes down in Georgia, and
he went down and bought a Curtiss Jenny
with the money that he had saved from his
stunting work. He fixed it up, and was
soon off barnstorming again. But I guess
the Jenny was too clumsy a boat for Lindy.
He wanted to fly the newer, better planes
that the army had. So he joined the army’s
training school at Brook Field, San Antonio.
This was when he was 22 years old.</p>
<p>“I guess he got along pretty fine at San
Antonio, and he was sent down to the pursuit
school at Kelly Field. He joined the
Caterpillar Club there. It was the first time
that he had to jump from a moving plane
and get down with his parachute. I guess
it was a pretty close shave.”</p>
<p>“Gee, how did it happen?” said Hal, his
eyes wide.</p>
<p>“Wait a second, I’m coming to it,” said
Bob. “He and another officer were to go
up and attack another plane that they called
the enemy. It was a sort of problem they
had to work out. Well, Slim dove at the
enemy from the left, and the other fellow
from the right. The enemy plane pulled
up, but Lindy and the other officer kept
on going, dead toward each other. There
was an awful crack, and their wings locked.
The two planes began to spin around and
drop through the air. Lindy did the only
thing there was to do. He kept his head,
stepped out on one of the damaged wings,
and stepped off backwards. He didn’t pull
the rip-cord until he had fallen quite a way,
because he didn’t want the ships to fall on
him. When he’d gone far enough, he pulled
the cord, and floated gently down. That
was the first.”</p>
<p>“And the second?” said Hal.</p>
<p>“The second,” went on Bob, “happened in
1927, just about a year before Lindy flew
the Atlantic. He took a new type of plane
up to test her. He put her through all the
stunts that he could think of, and she stood
them all right. It seemed as though she
was going to come through the test O.K.,
when Lindy put her into a tail spin. They
spiraled down for a while, and Lindy tried
to pull her out of it. She wouldn’t respond
and went completely out of control. Lindy
tugged and yanked at the controls, but he
couldn’t get that bus to go into a dive. He
did his best to save the ship, but it was no
use. He didn’t give up until they were
about 300 feet from the ground, which is
a mighty short distance to make a jump, if
you ask me. But Lindy made it, and
landed in somebody’s back yard, the wind knocked
out of him, but otherwise all right. That
was the second.”</p>
<p>“And the third?” asked Hal.</p>
<p>“We’re getting ahead of the story. In
fact, we’re ahead of the story already. Before
he made his second jump, Lindy had
joined the Missouri National Guard, and
was promoted to a Captaincy in the Reserve
and Flight Commander of the 110th Observation
Squadron. That’s how he got to be
a Captain, you know how he got to be a
Colonel.</p>
<p>“Then Lindy joined the Robertson Aircraft
Corporation, at St. Louis. While he
was with them, he helped map out the first
mail route from St. Louis to Chicago, and
was the first pilot to carry mail along this
route. Slim had a habit of starting things
off. He was the first to do a lot of things.
No sitting back and waiting for others to
start things. It was first or nothing for
him. Maybe it was his Viking ancestors, I
don’t know.</p>
<p>“It was while he was flying this route
that Lindy had his third initiation into the
Caterpillars. He took off one September
afternoon from Lambert Field, in St. Louis,
on his way to Maywood. Just outside of
Peoria a fog rolled in, so thick you could cut
it with a knife, Lindy could climb up over
it for flying, but he couldn’t land blind. He
dropped a flare, but it only lit up a cloud
bank. He saw lights, then, through the
fog, and knew that he was around Maywood,
but couldn’t get the exact location of
the field. He’d circled around for two hours,
when his engine sputtered and died. The
tank was dry. Lindy quickly turned on the
reserve gravity tank. There was twenty
minutes of flying in that tank, and Lindy
had to think fast.</p>
<p>“He tried flares again, but it was no use.
When he had just a few minutes of gas
left, he saw the glow of a town. He didn’t
want to take a chance on landing in a town
and killing somebody, so he headed for open
country. In a few minutes his engine died.
Lindy stepped out into the blind fog and
jumped. After falling a hundred feet, he
pulled the rip-cord, and left the rest to
chance. Every once in a while his ship appeared,
twirling away in spirals, the outside
of the circle about 300 yards away from
Lindy. He counted five spirals, and then
lost sight of the bus. He landed in a corn
field, shaken, of course, but all right. He
found his way to the farm house, and told
the farmer who he was. The farmer, who
had heard the crash of the plane as it smashed
to earth wouldn’t believe that this safe and
sound man was the pilot of it. Finally Lindy
convinced him, and they went in search
of the plane, which the farmer was sure had
landed close to his house. They found it
two miles away, looking not much like a
plane, but a heap of rubbish. The mail
wasn’t hurt. They got it to a train for
Chicago, and the mail went through. It always
does, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yup, it always does,” said Captain Bill.</p>
<p>“That reminds me of a story,” said Pat.</p>
<p>“Hold it,” said Bob. “I’ve got another
parachute for Lindy.”</p>
<p>“Fire away,” said Pat. “But remember
to remind me not to forget to tell you my
own story.”</p>
<p>“All right,” Bob put in. “Now the fourth
time Lindy jumped was not long before his
big flight. He was still flying for Robertson’s,
carrying mail to Chicago. Just south
of Peoria he ran into rain that changed to
snow. Lindy flew around, waiting for the
fog to lift, until he heard his motor sputter
and die. He was up about 13,000 feet when
he stepped out of the cockpit and jumped
into the air. He landed on a barbed wire
fence. Tore his shirt, but the plane was
pretty much of a wreck. He grabbed the
air mail; hurried to a train for Chicago, got
another plane, and flew the mail through.
A little late, but still, it got through. And
he didn’t bat an eye. Not one of the jumps
fazed him a bit.</p>
<p>“But it wasn’t as though Lindy jumped
at the slightest sign of anything going wrong.
He stayed with his plane until the very last
minute, doing everything he could to save
it. He hated worse than anything to have
a plane smashed up. Look how long he
stayed with that new plane he was testing
out—until he was just 300 feet above the
ground.</p>
<p>“Well, Lindy was one of the best mail pilots
that the Robertson corporation had, in
fact, he was their chief pilot. They could
depend on him to go out in weather that no
other pilot would think of bucking. He
didn’t show off. Just knew that he could
fly through anything, and he did.</p>
<p>“At this time there was a lot of excitement
in the air. Orteig was offering his $25,000
prize for the first man to cross the Atlantic,
and there were a lot of aviators who
would have liked the prize, and were trying
for it. Of course, the money wasn’t the
whole thing. There was the honor attached
to it. And besides, there was the fact that
crossing the Atlantic would make people
sit up and take notice that flying wasn’t as
dangerous as they thought. If a man could
fly all that distance in a plane, maybe
planes weren’t the death traps that some people
had an idea they were. Lindy must have
been thinking of this when he first decided
that he’d like to try for the Orteig prize. Because
everything that he’s done since his flight
has been to get people interested in aviation.</p>
<p>“But it takes money to fly across the ocean.
You’ve got to get a special plane and all
that. Lindy had to have backers. He
couldn’t get them at first. Everybody tried
to discourage him. In the first place, he
looked such a kid. He was twenty-five, and
that’s young, but he didn’t even look
twenty-five. The men he asked to back him all
but told him to run home and wait until
he had grown up.</p>
<p>“Then Major Robertson, Lindy’s Big
Boss, tried to get backers for him. He knew
that Lindy could fly and finally got some influential
men to put up $15,000 for his
flight. Maybe Lindy wasn’t glad! He tucked
his check in his pocket and went on a
shopping trip for a plane. He tried the
Bellanca people in New York, but they
didn’t have what he wanted, so he skipped
to San Diego to the Ryan Airways, Inc.,
and told them what he wanted. They put
their engineers to work on his specifications,
and designed him a Ryan monoplane, the
neat stream-lined job that was christened the
Spirit of St. Louis. It’s a graceful bird—but
you’ve all seen so many pictures of it,
you know what it looks like. It has a wing
span of 46 feet, and an overall length of
over 27 feet. They put in a Wright engine—a
Whirlwind, 200 horsepower. It’s a
radial engine. You two probably know what
a radial engine is, but Hal here doesn’t.”
Bob paused and turned to Hal. “Do you?”</p>
<p>“Uh-uh,” grunted Hal. “Do you?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. It’s one in which the
cylinders aren’t in a straight line or in a V,
but arranged around an axis, like the spokes
of a wheel. Lindy’s plane had two spark
plugs for each cylinder, so that in case one
missed, there was another one ready. She
could carry 450 gallons of gas and twenty
gallons of oil, and she was loaded to the
gills when Lindy took her off the ground
at the Field.</p>
<p>“Suppose Lindy wasn’t anxious about
that plane. He hung around the factory
all the time that it was being built, and
made suggestions to help along Hawley Bowlus,
who built the thing. You know Hawley
Bowlus. The fellow who held the glider
record until Lindy took it away from him—but
that’s later. Bowlus knows how to
build planes, and Lindy swears by him.</p>
<p>“Well, they got the plane finished in 60
days, which isn’t bad time. Out in New
York, Byrd and Chamberlin and the others
were getting ready to fly the Atlantic. It’s
wasn’t really a race to see who would be
first, but of course, there’s no doubt that
each one was anxious to be the first man
to cross the Atlantic. Because after all,
nobody likes to be second. So Lindy had to
get out to the east coast as fast as he could.
He could hardly wait for the plane to be
finished. But at last it was, and all the
equipment in place. Lindy climbed into the
cockpit to test her out. The cockpit was inclosed.
I don’t know whether I told that
before or not. Anyway, he could see out
little windows on each side, but he couldn’t
see ahead, or above him. So it was really
flying blind all the time, except for a sliding
periscope that he could pull in or out at the
side, in case he had to see straight ahead.
But Lindy doesn’t mind blind flying. He’s
a wonderful navigator.</p>
<p>“Well, Lindy turned over the motor of
his new plane, and it sounded sweet. He
hadn’t got it any more than off the ground
when he realized that this was the plane for
him. It responded to every touch, although
it was a heavy ship, and not much good
for stunting. But Lindy didn’t want to
stunt. He wanted to fly to Europe.</p>
<p>“It was on May 10, I think, that he
left San Diego. It was in the evening, not
quite six o’clock. The next morning, a
little after eight, he got into St. Louis. Took
him just a bit over fourteen hours, the whole
trip. It was the longest cross-country hop
that any one man had made up to that
time. His old pals at Lambert Field were
pretty glad to see him, and he spent the
night at his old stamping grounds. But he
didn’t stay long. Early in the morning he
got on his way, and made New York in
the afternoon, in not quite seven and a half
hours. Pretty flying.</p>
<p>“Nobody much had heard of Lindy until
he started from San Diego. Of course, he’d
been a dandy mail pilot, but they’re usually
unnamed heroes. Nobody hears about them,
and they never get their names in the paper
unless they crash. Not that they care.
They’ve got their jobs to do, and they do
them. But when Lindy flew that grand hop
from San Diego to St. Louis to New York,
people began to sit up and take notice. He
didn’t say much after he got to the Curtiss
Field.</p>
<p>“Out at Curtiss he spent his time seeing
that everything was ready, and all his instruments
O.K. He had a lot of confidence
in himself—he always has—but there was
no use in taking chances. In back of the
pilot’s seat was a collapsible rubber boat, that
he could blow up with two tanks of gas
that he carried with him. It had light oars,
and was supposed to be able to float him
for a week in case he decided suddenly to
come down in the middle of the Atlantic
instead of flying all the way across. Then
there were his regular instruments. He had
a tachometer, and an altimeter, an earth
inductor compass, a drift indicator, and—”</p>
<p>Captain Bill interrupted. “Just a minute,
just a minute. You say those things pretty
glibly. Do you know what they mean?
What’s a tachometer? Pat here doesn’t
know.”</p>
<p>Bob looked embarrassed. “Well, they’re all
pretty necessary instruments. I’ve been
meaning to look them up, that is, Gee, I
really ought to know, oughtn’t I?”</p>
<p>“You ought,” said the Captain severely.
“Do you mind if I interrupt your story for
just a minute and give you a few pointers?
This is mostly for you and Hal. You’ll
never be able to fly unless you understand
what the instruments on the dashboard are
for. Of course a lot of the old flyers, like
Patrick, here, flew just by instinct, and stuck
their heads out over the cockpit to see what
was happening. A real pilot nowadays,
though, can be sealed in his cockpit and
never see ahead of him from the time he
takes off until he lands, just so long as his
instruments are working. He can keep his
course over any country, no matter how
strange. You’ve got to know your instruments.”</p>
<p>“Well, tell us,” said Bob.</p>
<p>The Captain sat up. “I guess the first
thing that Lindy watched was the tachometer.
This is the instrument that shows the
number of revolutions per minute, or R.P.M.’s
that the engine is making. A flyer
must know how many R.P.M.’s his engine
must make to maintain a correct flying
speed, or he’ll go into a stall, which is bad.
I’ll tell you more about stalls later. The
altimeter registers the height at which the
plane is flying. It isn’t very accurate at
low altitudes, but it’s all right higher up.
You soon learn by the feel and the lay of
the land how high up you are. The exact
height doesn’t matter in ordinary flying, just
so that you keep a good altitude. Then
there’s that most important instrument, the
earth inductor compass. This is much more
accurate than a magnetic compass, and it
keeps the ship on its course. It operates in
regard to the electro-magnetic reactions of
the earth’s field, and directions are indicated
in reference to magnetic north. To steer by
this compass, you have to set your desired
heading on the controller, and then steer
to keep the indicator on zero. If you veer
to the left, the indicator will swing to the
left, and to keep on your course you must
bring your plane back to the right. When
he changes his course, the pilot consults his
maps and graphs, and makes a change in
the indicator of the compass.</p>
<p>“Then there is the air speed indicator,
which shows the speed of the plane in the
air. This is necessary so that the engine is
not over-speeded. A pilot never runs his
plane at full speed as a general thing, because
he’ll wear out his engine. He keeps
it at about 80 per cent of its potential speed,
which is a good safe margin.</p>
<p>“The turn and bank indicator also reads
from zero, and deviates from zero when the
plane dips. The bubble rides up to the
left when the plane banks right, and rides
up to the right when the plane banks left.
When the ship is again on an even keel,
the indicator goes back to zero. The pilot,
when he isn’t flying blind, can keep his plane
level by noticing the position of the radiator
cap or top of the engine in respect to the
horizon. But in a heavy fog, or if he can’t
see over his cockpit, the horizon doesn’t exist,
and a bank and turn indicator is his
instrument.</p>
<p>“The instruments that are no less important
than these are the oil gauge, the gasoline
pressure gauge, and the thermometer, which
shows whether the motor is overheating. If
the oil gauge shows that the oil is at a good
cool temperature, and the gasoline pressure
gauge shows that the gas pressure is up,
the pilot knows that his motor is running
nicely. The gas pressure gauge won’t tell
you how much gas you have left, though.
It’s always best to figure how much gas
you’re going to need on a trip, and then
take some over for emergencies. Most planes
also have an emergency tank, so that if one
tank gives out, the other can be switched
on, and will give the flyer time to maneuver
about until he finds a landing place.”
Captain Bill paused. “Well, those are your instruments.
I’ll probably have to explain
them all over to you again when the plane
comes, and I start to teach you to fly.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, not to me, you won’t,” Bob said.</p>
<p>Hal sat quietly looking out over the valley
below, saying nothing. He had listened
intently to the Captain’s instructions, but
there was an odd expression on his face.</p>
<p>Finally Pat snorted. Bob and the others
jumped.</p>
<p>“Hi, what’s the idea. Is there a story being
told, or isn’t there a story being told?
Get on with you.”</p>
<p>“It’s no fault of mine, Patrick,” said
Bob, looking meaningly at the Captain, who
appeared as innocent as a lamb. “I’m always
being rudely interrupted. But I’ll go on.
Where was I?”</p>
<p>“The Lindbergh lad was at Curtiss Field,
waiting this long time to be off,” said Pat.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. Well, when he got word that
the weather was O.K., he got his sandwiches,
his canteens of water, and started
off on the greatest flight in aviation history.
And I’ve told you about that.”</p>
<p>“We seem to be right back where we
started from,” the Captain said. “Is that
the end of your story?”</p>
<p>Bob laughed. “By no means. You’ve
got a lot to hear yet. What do you suppose
I’ve been collecting dope for all these weeks?
I’ve got a lot to tell you. Lindy wasn’t
satisfied with one great trip. He’s been flying
since, and has made some pretty important
jaunts. Things happened to him after
he got back to America loaded down with
about every kind of medal that one man can
get. And I’m going to tell you all of them.”</p>
<p>“I suppose we’ll have to listen. It’s part
of the game,” Pat said. “But not now,
my lad.” He rose stiffly from the grass.
“You’re mother will be looking for us, and
wondering what’s become of us. We’d better
get for home.”</p>
<p>“How about continuing in the next issue?”
laughed the Captain.</p>
<p>“O.K.” said Bob. “You get the rest of
it tonight, whether you like it or not.”</p>
<p>Hal looked up fervently at Bob. “Oh, we
like it, Bob. I think it’s a great story. A
great story.” The boy’s eyes shown in his
pale face. “Golly, Bob, it must be wonderful
to be able to do things like that.”</p>
<p>Bob looked uncomfortable as they walked
over to the car. “Well, kid, I don’t see
why anybody can’t do great things if he’s got
grit enough. That’s what it takes—Grit.”</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">CHAPTER VI—More About The Eagle</a></h1>
<p>It was after dinner at the Martin’s. Captain
Bill, Pat, and the two boys had gone
out to the garden. The Captain and Bob
were stretched out in two deck chairs, the
Captain’s long legs sticking out a long way
past the end of the low foot-rest. Pat lay
in the glider, swinging himself lazily, squeaking
in a melancholy rhythm at each forward
and back push, Hal, who had got permission
from his mother to eat dinner with the
Martin’s, lay on a rug thrown down on the
grass. The dusk was turning to dark, and
the Captain’s pipe was beginning to show
up as a dull glow in the fading light.</p>
<p>For a while nobody spoke. Then Pat
said, “Well, Robert, tell us the end of your
story.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking of where to start. We
left Lindy over in Europe, coming back to
the United States. He didn’t come right
back, though. He had to tour about some
of the foreign countries, as an ambassador
of good will, and get decorated with about
every kind of medal that was ever made. It
must have been pretty boring for him to go
to banquet after banquet, and listen to all
those speeches praising him. He must have
blushed like anything at some of those flowery
compliments. But he stayed calm, and
didn’t lose his head and get all swelled up
over the receptions and cheers and everything.
He knew that everybody meant every word
he said, and that they were mighty pleased
with him. They gave him all sorts of presents.
He could have started a store with
them. But I guess that most of them are
in the Lindbergh museum now.</p>
<p>“Well, the honors they heaped on Lindy
in France and England and Belgium were
nothing to what was waiting for him when
he got back to the United States. New
York turned out, it seemed, to a man. They
had a parade miles long, with Lindy the
chief attraction, sitting on top of an open
car, smiling at the mobs of screaming, shouting
people all along the way. It rained ticker
tape for hours, and people in offices tore
up telephone books and added the bits of
paper to the rainstorm. Nobody could do
enough for the Colonel.” Bob looked around
at the group. “He wasn’t the Captain any
more,” he explained. “He was now Colonel
Lindbergh. Well, anyway, there were banquets
and parties, until Lindy had to leave.
St. Louis started where New York left
off. After all it was St. Louis where Lindy
had found his backers, and naturally they
were pretty proud of him there. Slim took
it all smiling, just as modest as he’d been
from the beginning. There was no fussing
him. And the people loved it. Slim was
the most talked-about hero the United States
has ever adopted. Why, you remember that
almost everything from candy-bars to swimming
suits were named after him—and a
whole lot of new babies, too. All the kids
in America were crazy about him, and they
all wore aviator’s helmets and made plans to
become aviators as soon as they were old
enough. It seems that Lindy’s plan was
pretty successful. He wanted to get people
to talking and thinking about airplanes, and
believe me, they didn’t talk or think about
much else from the time he set out from
Roosevelt field.”</p>
<p>“You’d think that he’d be tired and ready
for a rest after his flight, and his receptions,
but even though he may have been tired,
he thought he’d strike while the iron was
hot, and follow up his good work, this
business of getting people aviation conscious.
And I guess, too, he felt that he owed something
to the people of the United States for
being so kind to him, so Lindy set out on
a trip around the country. He stopped at almost
every important city, and covered every
state in the union. He traveled almost 20,000
miles. And that’s some traveling. Just
think if he’d had to travel that distance
in a train! He’d be going yet. Well, every
place that he stopped gave him three rousing
cheers, and then some. You’d think
that by that time he’d be pretty tired. If it
had been me, I’d have turned around and bitten
some of the welcoming committee. But
not Lindy. He stuck it out, and smiled at
them all.</p>
<p>“And after the country-wide tour was
over, he took his Mexican and Central American
and South American trip. It was this
trip that clinched his name of ‘Good Will
Ambassador,’ although he’d been one to all
of the European countries that he went to.
In December, seven months after his famous
flight, he pointed the nose of the old Spirit
of St. Louis south, and lit out for Mexico
City.</p>
<p>“They were pretty anxious to see him
down there, and the Mexican National aviation
field was crowded long before Lindy
was due to get there. Everybody knew that
this was one flyer who always got places
when he said he’d get there. He was never
off schedule. So imagine how everybody felt
when the time set by him to reach Mexico
City passed, and no Lindy showed up. Well,
they were all set to call out the reserves, when
Slim Lindbergh winged into sight, and made
a sweet landing on the Mexican field.</p>
<p>“There was some cheering—more, maybe
than if he’d got there on schedule, although
you don’t see how that could be
possible. They gave Lindy a chance to explain
that he’d been lost in the fog, and then they
went on with their entertaining and celebrating.</p>
<p>“Mexico City was pretty important to
Lindbergh, although nobody knew it then.
Dwight Morrow was Ambassador to Mexico
then, and he had a daughter named Anne.
Well, I don’t like to get sentimental—I guess
I can’t tell romantic stories—well, anyway,
that part comes later.”</p>
<p>Captain Bill saw fit to interrupt the story
here. He saw that Bob was embarrassed,
and saw an opportunity to rub it in. “What
part?” he asked, innocently, knocking the
heel of ash from his pipe as he did so.</p>
<p>“Oh, you know, Lindy’s marrying Anne
Morrow, and that.”</p>
<p>“Well, we certainly demand the whole
thing. You can’t leave anything out,” insisted
Bill.</p>
<p>“Aw, all right, but it doesn’t come in
now.”</p>
<p>“We can wait,” said Bill, and settled back
satisfied.</p>
<p>“From Mexico City,” went on Bob, grateful
that his ordeal bad been put off, “Lindy
flew off down to Central America. First
he zig-zagged a bit to get in all of the little
countries, and went from Guatemala City
to Belize in British Honduras, and then
back again to San Salvador, and from then
on straight down the narrow isthmus to
Teguci—Teguci—well, that place in Honduras.”</p>
<p>“Tegucigalpa,” said Pat.</p>
<p>“That’s it,” said Bob. “And from Teguci—and
from there, he went on to Managua,
and then to Costa Rica—San Jose.
Now he was just about three hundred and
twenty-five miles from the Panama Canal,
as the crow flies—or rather, as Lindy flies,
which is much better than any crow I’ve
ever seen. He didn’t have any trouble making
the flight, and say that they weren’t glad
to see him down there, especially in the
Canal Zone, where the Americans lived.
They entertained him royally, and he went
into the jungles of Panama for a hunting
trip, which must have been great. They
have all sorts of wild hogs, deer and pheasants,
and it must have made grand hunting.</p>
<p>“But after all, Lindy couldn’t stay
anyplace very long. South America was waiting
for him. So he packed himself off, and
flew to Cartagena, in Colombia, adding another
continent to his list. From Cartagena
he flew to Bogota, and then straight across
the top of South America to the east coast.
He stayed at Maracay, Venezuela. I never
heard of it before, did any of you?” Bob
paused dramatically for a reply.</p>
<p>There was only a dead silence for a second,
and then, since none else spoke, Hal
felt called upon to confess his ignorance, “I
never did,” he said. “And gee, Bob, how
do you remember all these places that Lindbergh
stopped at? I never would in a hundred
years.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s easy,” said Bob airily. He did
not tell them of the long hours that he had
spent memorizing the towns and cities that
Lindbergh had stopped at in his good will
tour, nor the hundreds of times that he had
wished that Lindy had flown to some easy
place like Canada, where the names were all
pronounceable. But then, Lindy might have
flown to Wales, and Bob, having seen Welsh
names, thanked his lucky stars for such
places as Tegucigalpa and Bogota. And
now, having at least impressed Hal, he went
on with renewed enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Maracay,” he said, “was the jumping
off place for the thousand-mile jump to the
Virgin Islands. You see, Lindy was on his
way back to the United States. He hopped
from island to island in the Caribbean Sea,
stopping at San Juan, Porto Rico; Santo
Domingo; Port-au-Prince in Hayti; and
then to Havana. From Havana he made the
biggest hop of all, and landed smack in St.
Louis without sitting down once along the
way. He made some twelve hundred miles
in about fifteen and a half hours.</p>
<p>“Somebody figured up how long he had
flown, and how long he took for the whole
‘good will’ trip, and found out that he’d
made sixteen flights to fifteen countries, and
had gone 8,235 miles in one hundred and a
half hours. Of course, that was actual flying
time. The trip had taken him just two
months, because he got back to St. Louis on
February 13th, and he’d left Boiling Field at
Washington on December 13th. But in
those two months Lindy accomplished a
great deal. He’d made friends with all the
little countries down to our south, and with
Mexico, too. They understood us better,
and we got to understand them better. Gee,
wouldn’t it be great if airplanes would
make people friendlier? I mean, we’re so
close to each other now, it seems as though
we ought to know more about each other,
and like each other better. I may not be
saying that so well, but you fellows know
what I mean, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“That’s a very good philosophy,” said
Captain Bill, and Bob beamed as broadly
as the moon that had risen over the trees
and was shining over the little group in the
garden. “Let’s hope that you’re right.”</p>
<p>“Well, Lindy palled around with his old
buddies at St. Louis, and carried mail over
his old route to Chicago. He broke up his
flights with going to New York to get a
medal from the Woodrow Wilson Foundation
for international peace and understanding,
and then he went to Washington to get
the Congressional Medal of Honor. And
he had to get a new plane, too, from the
Mahoney people who made the Spirit of St.
Louis. I guess Lindy hated to part from the
old bus. It was still in great condition,
even though he’d flown 40,000 miles in it.
But they wanted to put it in the Smithsonian
Institution, and he had to get another.</p>
<p>“It was just about this time, in April
of 1928, that Lindbergh had to put his
flying to a stiff test. He was in St. Louis
when he learned that Floyd Bennett was
very sick with pneumonia up in Quebec.
Bennett was a great fellow, one of the most
popular aviators of his time. He’d flown
with Byrd to the North Pole, you remember.
And in April, although he was sick,
and knew he shouldn’t have gone, he flew
up to help Captain Koebl and Major Fitzmaurice
and Baron von Huenefeld, who’d
flown across the Atlantic, and were forced
down off the coast of Labrador. Well, he
landed with pneumonia in a Quebec hospital,
and they needed some serum in a hurry
to save his life. Lindy offered to fly with
it, and took off right away for New York.
It was 500 miles from New York to Quebec,
mostly through fog and snow, and blizzards,
but Lindy made it in three hours and
thirty-five minutes. The serum didn’t save
Floyd Bennett, though. That plucky scout
died the day after Lindbergh got there. He’d
put up a great fight, but it was no use. The
whole country felt gloomy over his death,
and Lindy especially so, although he’d done
his best to save his pal’s life.</p>
<p>“In June of that year, that is, in 1928,
Lindy,—maybe I should call him Charles
Augustus Lindbergh, was appointed the
chairman of the technical committee of the
Transcontinental Air Transport, the company
sending planes cross-country. This
gave him the chance to be right in on the
ground—or rather right in the air—of aviation
progress. It wasn’t just an office job,
either, because Lindy flew almost as much
after his appointment as before.</p>
<p>“In 1929 he kept right on flying. That’s
not really news. If Lindy stopped flying,
that would be news. But in February of
’29 he flew the first mail from Miami to
Colon, in the Panama Canal Zone. This
was the inauguration of the Pan-American
Airways.</p>
<p>“In February the Morrows announced
the engagement of Anne Morrow to Charles
Augustus Lindbergh. From then on the
reporters and photographers hung around
in order to be in at the wedding. But Lindy
and Anne fooled them. They were married
in April, and nobody knew anything about
it. They just got quietly married, and left
on their honeymoon in a yacht.</p>
<p>“From then on, whenever Lindy went on
a trip, Anne Lindbergh went with him.
She’s a great flyer, and helps Lindy fly on
long stretches. She pilots while he rests.</p>
<p>“The first long trip they took was in ’29.
That was the one through Central America
to Belize, in British Honduras. That covered
7,000 miles. But they didn’t stop long
at Belize. They’d gone there for a reason.
They headed their plane over the
Yucatan peninsula, looking for Mayan
ruins. You know, the Mayan Indians had
a wonderful civilization all built up long
before the white men came to Yucatan.
They had a huge empire, and big cities with
buildings as large as ours. Scientists are always
digging around down there to uncover
the ruins, so that they can find out
about the Indians, and how they lived, and
all that. But it’s hard to find the places
where the Maya Indians had their cities.
The jungle has grown up so thickly all
about them that it takes days and months
to get to them. And those that aren’t on
rivers are almost impossible to get to.</p>
<p>“So Lindy proved once more that the airplane
was a help to science, and flew over
the old Mayan hang-outs, looking for ruins.
He skimmed his plane over the tops of the
jungles, so low that it seemed he might almost
reach out his hand and grab a branch
of one of those giant trees that grow down
there, and he flew slowly, too, so that the
scientists that were with him could take
pictures.</p>
<p>“They found what they were after, three
cities that hadn’t ever been discovered before.
And it took only four days, where
it might have taken a party on foot months
to do the same thing. Anne Lindbergh
helped pilot the plane, and take pictures,
too.</p>
<p>“There weren’t any more exciting flights
that year, but early the next year, that is,
in 1930, Lindy ordered a new plane. It
was a Lockheed-Sirius, a monoplane with a
Wasp motor. It had a flattish-looking nose,
but it was graceful just the same. It had
something new that Lindy had designed
himself. That was two covers that could
be slid over the cockpits, so that the pilots
would be protected in bad weather.</p>
<p>“Lindy and Anne had a use for the plane
and the cockpit covers very soon. They
flew across the country one day and broke
the cross-country speed record that existed
then.</p>
<p>“Hardly anybody knew what they were
up to, and there were just a few people at
the Glendale airport, where they started
from. It was a terrible day, cold and rainy,
and the sun hadn’t come up yet to dry things
out. But the Lindberghs didn’t care. They
had on suits heated by electricity, because
they knew that it was going to be even
colder where they were going.</p>
<p>“A basket of sandwiches, 400 gallons of
gas, and they were ready. It was hard taking
off, because the load was heavy, but
Lindy got his flat-nosed Sirius into the air
beautifully, and they disappeared from
sight. Disappeared is the word, because for
hours nobody saw them. They were looking
for them, too, because you can bet on
it that as soon as the Lindberghs took off,
everybody knew about it. All over the west
the cowboys and Indians were gaping up to
see the blunt-nosed plane, but nobody saw
it.</p>
<p>“Then suddenly Anne and Lindy dropped
out of the sky at Wichita, Kansas, said hello,
they’d like some gas, they’d be in New
York about eleven, and sailed off.</p>
<p>“They were in New York around eleven,
too, and New York was waiting for them,
with auto horns, and whistles, and all the
other noise that it can make for people who
have gone out and done things. The Lindberghs
certainly had done just that. They’d
come across the country with one stop in 14
hours and twenty-three minutes and some
seconds, and had clipped two and a half
hours off the record then standing.”</p>
<p>“But what happened out’ west?” asked
Hal. “Why hadn’t anybody seen them?”</p>
<p>“Because you can’t see 10,000 feet into the
air, and that’s where the Lindberghs were
flying. Way above the clouds, from 10,000
to 15,000 feet high, flying blind, with
the cockpits closed to keep out the cold. It’s
mighty cold 15,000 feet up in the air. Flying
blind that way, they had to depend upon
their sextant to keep their course, and
Anne Lindbergh did her part by using this.
She did all the navigating from the back
cockpit, and took the controls part of the
time when Lindy rested.</p>
<p>“Lindy and Anne hadn’t intended to set
a record. At least, that wasn’t what they
set out to do. They wanted to test out flying
at high altitudes, because Lindy believes
that planes in the future will fly high to
avoid storms and wind, and that blind flying
should be encouraged. That’s why they
flew so high up, out of sight of all landmarks.</p>
<p>“There was no flying for Anne and Lindy
after that for a while, because in June that
year little Lindy was born. It seems awfully
sad now to talk about all the excitement
not only in this country, but all over
the world when that baby was born. Lindy
was the world’s hero, and his baby was
adopted by everybody just as Lindy had
been. Nobody could have dreamed what a
terrible end the Lindbergh baby would come
to.”</p>
<p>Bob paused. The events of the Lindbergh
baby’s kidnapping, and the finding of
its body a few months later, after the whole
world had searched for it, were still fresh.
In fact, they were too fresh for Bob to talk
about then, and with the silent consent of all
the men there, he passed over the horrible
details of the case, and in a few moments
went on with his story.</p>
<p>“The Lindberghs have another baby boy
now and everybody in the country will protect
this child. People all over the world
were heartbroken at the death of their first
baby.</p>
<p>“It was when the baby was a year old,
and didn’t require so much attention, that
Anne and Lindy started out on their longest
trip, the flight across the Pacific to China and
Japan. That was in July of 1931. There
was some delay in choosing the route, because
they had to consider all sorts of things,
like chances for refueling, and over-water
flying distances, but finally they decided
that they’d fly across Canada to Point Barrow,
in Alaska, and from there to Nome;
then across the Ocean to Karaginsk, from
there to Nemuro, and on to Tokyo.”</p>
<p>Captain Bill broke in. “Good for you
for remembering that. Did you memorize
the route?”</p>
<p>“I did,” said Bob proudly. “I even drew
a map of it. They flew roughly northwest,
and then south again, making the two sides
of a triangle, with the point up at the top
of Alaska.</p>
<p>“Well, the Lindberghs made their usual
careful preparations. They needed more
than a ham sandwich for this trip. The
plane they chose was a low-winged Lockheed
Sirius with a Wright Whirlwind motor.
It was a blunt-nosed ship, painted reddish
orange and black. And since they were
traveling over water, it had to be equipped
with floats. These were a new kind of Edo
float, which were grooved on at the bottom
to make for less resistance of the water.</p>
<p>“In the tail of the plane they had a pretty
complete emergency kit, which would pop
out automatically if the plane went under.
It had a folding life boat in it, that they
could fill from a bottle of compressed air.
It was pretty smooth, with a mast and sail
and everything, and though they didn’t;
have to use it, it was a mighty nice thing to
have along in case they sat down in the
middle of the ocean. Then, of course, they
had food and water, and an emergency
radio set, besides the one that Anne
Lindbergh was going to use. This emergency
one was ready for anything. You couldn’t
hurt it by getting it wet, or by dropping it.
In fact, they tested it by dropping it from a
hangar, and then soaking it in water for 24
hours. I wouldn’t want anybody to do that
to my radio set, but I guess nothing much
happened, because the tough radio survived
its tests, and went along with the Lindberghs
to China. The rest of their equipment
included fifty pounds of food, five
canteens of water, blankets, and all that sort
of thing.</p>
<p>“On July 27th, Anne and Lindy started
out. Washington was their first stop, to
make the first leg official. From there they
went to New York, bound for Maine, to say
goodbye to the baby. But there was trouble
right at the start. About two hours after
they had left New York, the Lindberghs had
to turn back again. Somebody had tampered
with their radio, and put it out of
working order. But this was fixed up all
right, and they started out again. They got
to North Haven, Maine, in about three and
a half hours.</p>
<p>“After spending some time at North
Haven with Anne’s parents and the baby, they
left for Ottawa, and from Ottawa for
Moose Factory. Just out of Ontario,
though, they disappeared. The newspapers
ran big headlines, ‘Lindberghs Missing.’ But
they weren’t really missing. That is, the
Lindberghs knew all along where they were,
but their radio was out of order, and they
couldn’t tell anybody else. Pilots were sent
out to search for them, and Pilot Clegg
found them in Moose Factory, safe and
sound.</p>
<p>“Moose Factory sounds awfully funny,
doesn’t it? I’d never heard of it, before the
Lindberghs landed there, but it’s quite a
place. All one hundred of its people came
out to cheer the flyers.</p>
<p>“On Sunday morning they left Moose
Factory, for their 750 mile jump to Churchill
Harbor, in Manitoba. The weather
wasn’t very good for flying—gray and
stormy, and the country was gray and flat.
All in all, it wasn’t a very pleasant leg of
their journey, and there was almost nine
hours of it. I’ll bet they were glad when
they flew into Churchill Harbor, and saw the
whole town waiting for them. There were
only 2,000 people in the town, but then,
that probably looked like a pretty big crowd
after all that flying over country without
seeing anybody or anything. And those
2,000 made up for it by being awfully
noisy.</p>
<p>“Baker Lake is 375 miles from Churchill,
and that was the next stop. Just three and
a quarter hours after they’d left Churchill
Harbor, they got into Baker Lake. Everybody
was waiting for them, and everybody
in this case was made up of Eskimos. There
are only about six white people in the whole
place, but they were out, too, and took
charge of the Lindberghs when they landed
that night. So far so good.</p>
<p>“The Lockheed up to now was working
perfectly—the trip was going off as scheduled—just
as all of Slim’s trips go off as
scheduled. From Baker Lake the going was
to be harder. The next stop was Aklavik,
on the MacKenzie River. Aklavik is pretty
far north, just about 130 miles within the
Arctic Circle, and the route called for a
jump of over 1,000 miles across this cold
country. But Slim and Anne made it. They
did that 1,000 miles in eleven and a half
hours, which was some going. They had
the Aurora Borealis with them, because the
farther north they went, the brighter the
lights grew, and flying at night was as easy
as flying by day.</p>
<p>“Aklavik may be cold, but it was warm
to the Lindberghs. Slim and Anne saw a lot
of things they’d never seen before, and they
had what you’d call their first real taste of
the arctic. There were all the people you
read about up there—Mounties, and Eskimos
and fur trappers, who’d trekked in
from miles around to see the Lindberghs
land. Eskimo kids trailed them around and
grinned when they were spoken to.</p>
<p>“They had a lot of time to look around,
too, because they had to stay at Aklavik for
three days. The weather grounded them,
but on August 7th, the sky cleared, and they
were off again, now for Point Barrow. Nome
was next. But before they got to Nome
there was trouble.</p>
<p>“They’d started out from the Point in the
morning, and flew all day. All they saw
was packed ice for miles around. A thick
fog was raising. Finally at 11 o’clock that
night the fog grew so thick that the Colonel
and his wife thought it would be best just
to sit down and wait for the fog to clear.
So that’s what they did. They sat down in
Shismaref Bay, on Kotzebue Sound.”</p>
<p>At this point Bob paused significantly,
and waited. He had pronounced both
words without hesitation of any kind, and
he was waiting for the praise that he felt
was due him. There was a strange silence.
So Bob said again: “They sat down on
Shismaref Bay, on Kotzebue Sound.”</p>
<p>This time Captain Bill realized what was
required of him. “Good work,” he said
“You got them both without a slip.”</p>
<p>Now Bob could go on. “They sat
down,” he began.</p>
<p>“That they did,” interrupted Pat. “They
sat down on Shismaref Bay on Kotzebue
Sound. What heathen names. But we’ve
heard them, and get on with you, lad.”</p>
<p>“I am,” said Bob, and got on. “They had
to wait for ten hours for the fog to lift, and
it must have been mighty uncomfortable in
the cockpits of their planes. When they
finally did get started, they found that they
couldn’t get to Nome after all. The fog
drifted up again, and they had to come
down—”</p>
<p>Pat broke the silence with a mighty exclamation.
“Not on Shismaref Bay!”</p>
<p>Bob was cold. “Of course not. This time
they came down on Safety Bay, and please
don’t interrupt.”</p>
<p>But there was another interruption, this
time from Hal. “Where’s Safety Bay?” he
asked.</p>
<p>Bob stretched out comfortably. He was
satisfied with himself and his story. “I don’t
know whether you’re just trying to test me,
or not,” he said, “but I’m prepared for you.
I’ve been over every inch of the Lindbergh
trip with an atlas, and I know where everything
is located, and how to pronounce it.”</p>
<p>Hal, his pale face lighted up by the moonlight,
was obviously impressed, and his large
eyes beamed in the light. He was storing up
notes for his own story that was to come
later.</p>
<p>“Safety Bay,” said Bob, “is twenty-one
miles from Nome, and mid-way between
Nome and Solomon Beach. They call it
Safety Bay because fishermen caught in
storms out at sea used to come in to the bay
for safety. It was a ‘safety bay’ for the
Lindberghs, too, all right. They waited for
the fog to lift again, and they finally got
to Nome. Nome had been waiting so long
for them that it gave them a right royal welcome.</p>
<p>“Nome was an important stop, because
the Lindberghs planned to use this as their
jumping off place for the hop across the Pacific
Ocean to Karagin Island, off the Kamchatkan
Peninsula. The Pacific has been
crossed before, and was crossed later, too, by
Herndon and Pangborn. But it’s a tricky
place to cross, especially in the northerly part,
where the Lindberghs were to cross. It’s a
place of fog and ice, and quickly changing
wind currents, so that a fog can creep up on
you and blot out the world in a split second.</p>
<p>“Well, this was the ocean that the Lindberghs
were going to cross. And they crossed
it. On Friday, August 14th, they started
out. They were the first to cross by that
route, blazing a new aviation trail. For half
an hour there was silence. Then the St. Paul
Naval station in the Pribiloffs made the first
radio contact. Anne Lindbergh signaled
that everything was all right, the weather
was good, and the flying fine. Every half
hour the station sent out signals, and gave
directions, because up north there, so near
the magnetic pole, a regular compass is
thrown way off.</p>
<p>“St. Lawrence Island was the first land
in their path; then from St. Lawrence to
Cape Naverin the route was over water
again, about 250 miles. Finally the radio
operator got the message that they’d sighted
Cape Naverin, and that everything was O.
K. They got to Karagin Island early in the
morning. And that means they flew over
1,000 miles in less than 11 hours. Which
is some flying over that treacherous route.</p>
<p>“The Lindys stayed at the Island for just
a little while to rest up, and then took off
for the southern end of the Kamchatkan
Peninsula, for Petro—Petro—” Bob paused,
embarrassed. “Say, what’s the name of that
place at the southern end?” he asked.</p>
<p>Bill felt called upon to answer. “Petropavlovsk,”
he said.</p>
<p>Bob tried it. “Petro—Petro-what?”</p>
<p>“Petropavlovsk,” repeated Bill.</p>
<p>They all tried it then, with varying degrees
of success. Finally Bob got it.
“Petropavlovsk,” he said proudly, and was able
to go on with his story. “It was an easy
flight, and they made it in about four hours.
But Nemuro was next.</p>
<p>“Nemuro’s on the tip of Hokkaido Island,
and to reach it the Lindberghs had to fly
across the Kurile Islands, the worst fog trap
in the world. There’s a warm Japanese
ocean current that flows up here and hits the
cold arctic blasts, so that there are sudden
fogs that you can’t possibly see through.
And besides, there are volcanic peaks that
stick their peaks up but of the water. Some
are dead and some are alive, but they’re all
pretty bad news for an airplane if it happens
to come in contact with one of them.</p>
<p>“The start was pretty good. The sky
was clear, and the visibility good. But they
should have known better than to trust such
luck. They’d been out about 500 miles
when a thick blanket of fog came up from
nowhere and wrapped them around. A
minute before they’d been able to see Muroton
Bay, but when they turned back, it had
disappeared. There were two things for
them to do, and neither one pleasant. They
could either fly on in the fog, and risk
hitting a peak or losing their course, or land
in the water. This was hardly better than
going on, because the currents are very
dangerous around there, and their plane
might easily be capsized. But they decided
that it was better to land. They landed on
the sheltered side of a place called Ketoi Island,
and put their radio to work sending
out an S.O.S.</p>
<p>“It didn’t take long for somebody to get
to them. The Japanese government ordered
two ships to Ketoi to help them. One was
the Shimushiru, and it stood by all night,
while the Lindberghs spent the night doubled
up in the cockpit of their plane. They stood
by because of the danger. You see, the island
is pretty wild, and is inhabited by Hairy
Ainus, who live in caves. They’re white
people, and they’re supposed to have lived
all over Japan once, but they’re not very
pleasant to have around, especially if you’re
unprotected. But with the Japanese ship
standing by, the Lindberghs were safe.</p>
<p>“In the morning the ship towed the Lockheed
Sirius to Muroton Bay, and while it
was sort of quiet, Lindy fixed up a wet spark
plug and they were ship-shape again, and
raring to go. But the fog wouldn’t lift.
Finally it seemed to lift, and they started
off.</p>
<p>“When they got to the island of Iturup
a thick fog came up from nowhere and
cut off their visibility again. Then a radio
message told them that the safest place
to land was at Shana, so at Shana they
landed. And at Shana they stayed, too,
grounded by the fog. But finally the fog
lifted, and they were able to get to Nemuro.</p>
<p>“Tokyo next. And Tokyo was glad to
see them! There were over 30,000 people
at the airport when they landed. The Lindys
were just as popular as ever, and just
as much the good will ambassadors as ever.
They were taken all over Tokyo, ate with
chopsticks, lived through a little earthquake,
and did as the Japanese did generally.</p>
<p>“Lindbergh told the Japanese people what
he had set out to do, and that he hoped that
there’d be a regular airplane route between
Japan and the United States. He said that
he thought the route would be from the
north, too, but a little south of the one
that he and Anne had taken.</p>
<p>“Japan liked the Lindberghs, but they had
to leave, bound for China. That was in
September. Japan and China hadn’t decided
yet to go to war, but things were pretty bad
in China, anyway. The Yangtze Kiang
and the Hwai river had overflowed and
flooded hundreds of villages and cities. Together
they’d covered about 1,000 square
miles of land, so you can imagine in what
sort of condition China was then. Everything
that goes with flood had come to China
too, including starvation and disease. The
Relief Committee was doing all that it could
to help the inland people, but it couldn’t
do much, because there was no way of communicating
with them, and of finding out
who needed aid, and what towns had been
flooded.</p>
<p>“As soon as Lindy landed in Nanking,
he volunteered to help the Chinese government
by making surveys of the flooded land.
The government accepted his offer, and Lindy
flew over the country, making reports
of districts that were under water. He found
a lot of places that no one knew about, and
did wonderful work. At one place he landed
on the water in a village that was completely
covered. He had a doctor and
medical supplies with him, but the poor Chinese
thought that he had brought food. They
paddled over to the plane, grabbed the supplies
and tore them to shreds, looking for
something to eat. Lindy and the doctors
took off as soon as they possibly could. As
a result of this, Lindy advised that all supplies
should be brought by armed guards,
and that food was the most urgent need
at the moment. Because of the good work
that he did, the President of China gave
Lindy another medal to add to his collection,
the Chinese Aviation Medal.</p>
<p>“In October the Lindbergh’s trip was suddenly
cut short, in the first place, by an accident
that might have proved pretty serious.
The Colonel, Anne, and a doctor were setting
out for a survey of the Tungting Lake
district, and were to take off in the Yangtze.
But just as they were about to leave the
water the current caught one of the wings,
and it crumpled up. The plane turned over,
and threw them all into the river. They
were all weighed down by their heavy suits,
and could easily have drowned, but they
were pulled out of the water. The Lockheed
was pulled up on board a British carrier,
and Anne and Lindy decided to go to Shanghai
with it and wait while it was being repaired.</p>
<p>“While they were on board the Hermes,
the aircraft carrier, they got word that
Dwight Morrow, Anne’s father, had died.
This meant that their trip was over, since
they had to get back to the United States
as quickly as possible. They took a steamer
to Vancouver, and then flew across the country
to Maine.”</p>
<p>“From then on the Lindberghs dropped
out of the news, because they wanted to.
And they didn’t figure in the news again
until that terrible day when their baby was
kidnapped. That was on March 1st, you
remember. But in spite of everything that’s
happened, Lindy is carrying on, and so is
Anne Lindbergh. They’re still the country’s
most loved couple.</p>
<p>“Lindy’s still working hard at aviation,
and trying to make the world aviation conscious.
That’s what he says his aim is,
and that’s what he makes his trips for. He
wants people to get so used to airplanes
that they’ll ride in them just like they ride
in automobiles, without thinking twice
about it. He hasn’t had any serious accidents,
because he’s always careful that everything’s
in perfect order before he starts on a
flight. That’s part of his program. He
wants to make people see that if you’re cautious
enough, flying isn’t dangerous.</p>
<p>“I think that Lindy’s succeeded in what
he’s tried to do. The world, and especially
the United States was never more interested
in aviation than in the year that Lindy flew
across the Atlantic. That made them sit up
and take notice. The United States was
way behind Europe in air service, but since
it perked up and got interested in what could
be done, why, its been getting ahead by
leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>“And we mustn’t forget that the most important
thing about Lindy is that he was
born with wings. He wasn’t made a flyer,
he just was one. I’ve seen him give an exhibition,
when we went to see the air races,
and golly, you could tell his plane from
anybody else’s in the world. He handles it
so easily, and takes it off like a thistle and
brings it down like a feather. A plane’s just
part of him.</p>
<p>“And besides that, he’s as modest as they
come. Of course, that’s an old story. Everybody
knows that. But it still strikes me
as pretty marvelous that a man can make a
big success when he’s only 25, and then go
on as though nothing had happened, sticking
to his work, only working harder than
ever. If anybody gets my vote, it’s Lindy,
even if he was running for President, and I
was old enough to vote.” Bob stopped.
“Well,” he said then, “I guess that’s the end
of my story.”</p>
<p>It was pretty late. The moon had gone
down, and the garden was dark, with the
four men making four mounds of deeper
black where they sat. Suddenly a light in
the house switched on, sending out a stream
of light that picked out Bob, his hair tousled,
his eyes blinking in the sudden glare.</p>
<p>Hal started. “It must be late,” he said
anxiously. “I’d better be getting on. The
night air—I shouldn’t have stayed so long.”</p>
<p>The screen door of the house slammed,
and a figure approached, then down the
garden walk, strangely burdened.</p>
<p>“Hang around,” said Captain Bill, starting
up. “This is going to be interesting.”
He hurried down the path and met Bob’s
mother, whose strange burden turned out
to be a tray with glasses and a covered dish.
He took the tray from her. “You can’t go
now,” he called to Hal. “Look what we’ve
got.” He set the tray down, and lifted the
napkin from the plate. “Home baked cookies,”
he said, and took one. “You should
have joined our group sooner,” he said to
his sister, between bites.</p>
<p>“Because I brought cookies, I suppose, if
for no other reason,” she said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Why, Meg, you know that you’d be
welcome even without cookies. You should
have been here to hear your son and my
nephew tell a grand story in a grand way.”</p>
<p>Bob felt himself blushing in the dark.
Praise from Bill was rare and much sought
after. “Aw,” he said, “it wasn’t anything.”</p>
<p>“It was a good yarn,” said Bill, emphatically.</p>
<p>“If it was a good yarn, then he’s your
nephew, all right,” said Mrs. Martin. “There
was never anybody like you for yarning.
And good ones, too.”</p>
<p>Captain Bill laughed, and took another
cookie. “If I can tell stories the way you
bake cookies—”</p>
<p>He didn’t finish his sentence. Hal had been
standing nervously at the edge of the group,
waiting for a chance to break in. Now he
broke in, chance or no chance. “I’ve got
to go, really I do,” he said. “My mother
will be worried. Thanks a lot for everything.
Goodnight.” He broke into a run,
and disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>Captain Bill looked after him. “Say,
what’s the matter with Hal? What was his
hurry?”</p>
<p>Bob was a little embarrassed. He hated
to talk disloyally about his friend, but he
felt that Bill ought to know. “I guess he’s
afraid to be out so late alone. You see,
Hal’s pretty much of a baby yet. He’s afraid
of a lot of things he oughtn’t to be afraid
of, and he’s always afraid that his mother’s
worrying about him.”</p>
<p>“I think that it’s his mother’s fault,” said
Mrs. Martin. “She’s pampered him and
spoiled him until he can’t do a thing or think
for himself. She just didn’t know that the
best way to rear a boy is to give him plenty
to eat and a place to sleep and let him take
care of himself.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I turned out so well, isn’t
it, Mother?” said Bob.</p>
<p>His mother laughed. “Oh, I don’t know
about you. You must be the exception
that proves the rule.”</p>
<p>Bill spoke suddenly. “There ought to
be something done about Hal,” he said. “I
like that boy. He’s got the stuff there, but
he needs something to bring it out. How
about it, Bob?”</p>
<p>“I think so, Bill,” said Bob, pleased that
Captain Bill had seen so much in his friend.
“I’ve been trying to help Hal, and I think
that he’s getting much better than he was,
don’t you, Mother?”</p>
<p>“I have noticed an improvement,” said
Mrs. Martin.</p>
<p>“There’ll be more before I go home,” said
Captain Bill.</p>
<p>“Don’t hog the cookies,” said Pat, making
his first, but most important contribution
to the conversation. But Pat, though
he had said nothing, had thought a lot.</p>

<div class="section" id="chapter-viia-close-shave">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">CHAPTER VII—A Close Shave</a></h1>
<p>The next two weeks were hectic ones
for Pat, the Captain and their two friends,
with Pat teaching the boys to fly, the boys
learning to fly, the Captain generally directing
all activities, and three of them planning
and preparing for their flight to the Adirondacks.
Hal couldn’t go. It was with real
sorrow that he told them that his mother
would not permit him to go with them. Hal
was beginning to enjoy better his flights
into the air, and his companionship with
his new friends. Pat did not frighten him
at all now, and his happiest hours were
those that he spent with him, Bob and Captain
Bill. He knew that he would be very
lonesome if they went off without him, but
no amount of persuasion on his part would
move his mother in her determination that
he should not go. She had so many arguments
on her side that Hal was completely
floored when he tried to point out to her
the reasons why it would be perfectly safe
for him to go with his friends.</p>
<p>Bob was downcast. He knew that he
would have a good time with Pat and Bill,
but he knew too that he’d have a better
time if someone his own age were along.
After all, he couldn’t do anything as well
as Pat and Bill. He couldn’t fly a plane,
although he was learning rapidly, and would
soon be able to take a solo flight; he couldn’t
shoot as accurately as they; nor land a
mountain trout so well. Hal, who was also
a novice, would have been just as inexpert
as he was at all these things, and would
have made him feel not quite so stupid. And
then there were always things to talk about
to Hal that the others wouldn’t be able to
understand—in fact, Hal and he spoke a
language of their own. It would have been
fun if Hal could have come along—but if
he couldn’t go, he couldn’t go. Bob
decided that he’d better take the matter philosophically.
So he joined in the plans of
the Captain and Pat with all his usual energy.
Hal helped, too, Even if he was not
going with them, he wanted to get the thrill
at least of being in on the start.</p>
<p>They were all down at the airport every
day, rain or shine. Pat gave them a good
background of ground work, and then let
them fly with him. Bob, with his natural
quickness, could have flown solo almost after
his first flight, but Pat would not take the
responsibility of letting the boy go up alone.</p>
<p>Hal, on the other hand, had more obstacles
to overcome. The first was the terror
that he had felt on his first flight. However,
after repeated flights, and the feeling of
power that he gained from actually having
the controls in his hands, he overcame his
fear enough to fly with Pat, and fly well.</p>
<p>Two days before their departure for the
mountains, Pat and Bill decided that the
boys ought to make their solo flights, so
that Hal would have made a solo flight before
they left him.</p>
<p>Pat had taken the Marianne up into the
air, had “taken a look about,” and
landed her again. He turned to the two boys
and asked, “who’s first?”</p>
<p>“Me,” said Bob.</p>
<p>“All right,” said Pat, and Bob climbed
into the cockpit smiling confidently.</p>
<p>“See you soon,” called Bob, and waved
a hand in farewell. He taxied the plane out
over the runway, turned her nose into the
wind, and felt her rise from the ground.
He felt a thrill of power as the machine
responded to the slightest movement of
the stick. He had control of all the boundless
energy stored in that motor, and could
direct this huge craft in any direction he
chose. He felt the blast of wind against
his face. He was off the ground now, flying
low, just clearing a small tool house.
He pointed the nose of the Marianne up and
climbed slowly, then leveled off again. His
instruments showed that he was flying at
about a thousand feet up. The motor sounded
good. The air was smooth. Bob felt
a keen exhilaration. He wanted to shout in
triumph. At last he was flying a plane,
alone.</p>
<p>Again he pointed the nose up into the air,
and climbed to about 5,000 feet. The sky
was clear and cloudless. He lost all track
of time and space. He seemed to be by himself
in the universe. But he knew that he
wasn’t. The others would be expecting him
back. Reluctantly he banked and turned
around, and headed once more for the airport.
He throttled down the motor and
glided swiftly to earth. He saw the grass
below turn green as he approached it; he
leveled off. In his excitement, he kept the
tail of the plane a little too high, his front
wheels landed too soon, and he felt for a
breath-taking moment that he was going
over on his nose. But the Marianne righted
herself, and taxied docilely along the ground.</p>
<p>Bob jumped out, pushing back his goggles.
“How was that?” he shouted to Pat and
Bill, who came running up to him.</p>
<p>Pat glowered. “What a landing!” he said,
in disgust. “Young man, is that the sort of
landing I taught you?”</p>
<p>Bob’s smile faded, and he looked crestfallen.
“I didn’t level off,” he said.</p>
<p>“Of course you didn’t. A blind man
could tell you that.” Then Pat’s voice suddenly
changed. “But you handled her like
a veteran,” he said. “You’ve got the makings
of an ace in you, lad.”</p>
<p>Bob’s ready grin spread quickly over his
face again. “Did I really?” he cried. “Bill,
what did you think?” He was perfectly
willing to hear himself praised, now that
he was sure that his performance has been
good.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re all right,” said Bill grudgingly.
“How about Hal? It’s his turn
now.” He turned to Hal. “You show this
young fellow how to make a three point
landing,” he said, and gave Hal a little clap
on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Hal came forward. He was unusually
silent, and his face was pale. He had struggled
with his fear and he felt that he had
conquered it. He had come to have confidence
in his handling of the Marianne with
Pat or Bill in the other cockpit, ready to
take the controls if anything went wrong.
Now he would have confidence taking her
up alone. He set his jaw grimly and got
into the cockpit. The motor was warm, and
sounded good. Hal took the Marianne into
the air with a grace that made Pat and Bill
look at each other with surprise and congratulation.</p>
<p>“The kid’s got the stuff, all right,” said
Bill. “I knew he had. Who said he didn’t
have nerve?”</p>
<p>“He’s better for it, too,” said Pat. “It’s
done him good, all right.” They watched the
plane climbing into the cloudless skies. Then
suddenly the sound of the motor ceased.
“Good grief,” cried Pat. The others were
too horrified even to cry out. They saw
the plane stall, then fall nose down, spiraling
as it went.</p>
<p>When he heard the motor conk, Hal’s
heart stood still. He tried the stick frantically.
The rudder, the ailerons, would not
respond. The throttle brought no answering
roar of power. The Marianne had become
suddenly a mad thing, an enemy, bent
on his destruction. She side-slipped, her
nose dipped down, an she went into a
tailspin.</p>
<p>Hal was frantic. His first impulse was to
pull up on the stick, in order to bring up
the tail. Then some glint of reason came
through his terror, and he remembered Pat’s
warning that this was the last thing he
should do to pull himself up. But what
had Pat said? He couldn’t remember. Then
suddenly it came to him. Push forward on
your stick! With an effort he made himself
push forward. The Marianne gave a convulsive
shudder. But the action had taken
her out of her spin. With a feeling of unutterable
relief Hal felt her come out of her
spin and go into a glide. He looked over
the side of the plane. He was rushing toward
a brick building, at the furthest end
of the airport! There was nothing to do
now but crash. He was too close to stretch
out the glide!</p>
<p>With a last desperate movement, Hal
opened the throttle of his engine. The motor
caught! With a thrill of joy he heard the
roar of the motor as it started again, and
felt the stick respond to his touch. He pulled
back the stick, the nose of the plane lifted,
and he zoomed into the air.</p>
<p>Down on the ground Pat, Bill and Bob
had gone through the tortures of the damned,
watching Hal fall to what seemed certain
death, while they stood helplessly below.
When they saw him zoom once more into
the air, their hearts bounded with him.</p>
<p>“The gas-line must have been clogged!”
shouted Pat. “It cleared itself out when
they dived!”</p>
<p>“Thank God,” said Bill.</p>
<p>Bob could say nothing, but kept shouting
Hal, Hal, Hal, over and over again. Hal
was gliding in, now, to land.</p>
<p>He got out of the cockpit, white and shaking.
The others, beside themselves with joy,
surrounded him, shaking his hand, hugging
him, patting his shoulder. But Hal did not
seem to notice what was happening.</p>
<p>“You handled that plane like Lindbergh!”
shouted Pat. “Good boy.”</p>
<p>But all that Hal said was, “I’m never
going up again.”</p>
<p>Pat had gone over to the plane to look
it over. “It seems all right,” he said, turning
off the motor that he had tested. “But
there must have been a bit of dirt in the
line leading from the gas tank. You had
a lucky escape, lad. It was quick thinking
that you did up there. I’m proud of you.”</p>
<p>But Captain Bill saw that Hal was in
no mood for praise. He knew, too, that
the best cure for the boy was to take him
right up again into the air, so that he
would have no time to develop a phobia
against going up. But he would not risk
taking up the Marianne until it had had a
thorough overhauling.</p>
<p>The Captain put his arm around Hal’s
shoulder. “You mustn’t say that you’re
never going up again, Hal, old man,” he
said. “You proved yourself up there. You’re
going to make a great flyer.”</p>
<p>“It was great, Hal, great,” said Bob. “I
would have crashed the old bus and killed
myself. I couldn’t have kept my head.”</p>
<p>Hal said nothing except that he wanted
to go home. Pat stayed behind with the
plane while the other three went over to
the parking lot to get their machine. “Don’t
say anything to my mother, whatever you
do,” said Hal. “I don’t want her to worry.
After all, nothing really happened to me,
and why should she be frightened for nothing?”</p>
<p>Bob and the Captain promised to say
nothing. In fact, they spoke very little on
the way home. Hal was worn out
emotionally and the others were occupied with their
own thoughts.</p>
<p>The Captain was worried by the new
turn that affairs had taken. He was disappointed
that all the progress that had been
made in Hal’s education had been ruined
on the first solo flight. It would have been
all right if he had been able to take Hal
into the air again, but he couldn’t. Tomorrow
they would be too busy with their preparations
to do any flying, and the day after
that, they would start for the Adirondacks,
leaving Hal behind. Without his friends,
and with the memory of his terror fresh in
his mind, Hal would fall back into his old
fears, and be actually worse off than ever.
The time to cure Hal was at once, if at all.</p>
<p>Captain Bill had an idea. He thought
about it rather carefully most of the way
home, and when they were almost home, he
broached his plan. “Say, Hal, how about
coming over tonight—with your mother?
I’m going to tell my story after dinner, tonight,
and I thought maybe she’d like to
hear it.”</p>
<p>Hal was rather surprised. His mother
rarely visited, and did not see very much of
the Martins. In fact, she had been to the
Martins only twice since they had been neighbors,
and one of those visits had been to return
Mrs. Martin’s formal call upon her new
neighbor when the Greggs had moved into
the house next door. But Hal said, “Why,
I’ll ask Mother. I don’t think she’s busy,
and I guess she’d like to hear your story,
Captain Bill. I’ve been telling her about
the stories, you know.”</p>
<p>“Good,” laughed the Captain. “Don’t
tell her too much, though. I want her to
come to hear them.”</p>
<p>“I think she’ll like to come,” said Hal.
Thinking it over, he felt convinced that his
mother should hear Captain Bill’s story
that night. He knew she would enjoy the
evening with them all. They were a jolly
lot, and Mrs. Martin often was lonesome
when Hal went off and left her alone. She
would be better for a night of company.
And perhaps—well, Hal could not dare to
hope—perhaps she would approve more of
his going on a trip with these men if she
knew how splendid they were. But then
Hal shuddered. They were going to fly to
the mountains. And he was never going to
fly in a plane again. He felt that he would
rather do anything in the world than put
himself in a position again where he might
experience the awful horror of feeling himself
going into a nose dive.</p>
<p>They let Hal off at his home. When Bob
and the Captain were alone, Bob asked why
Bill had thought of inviting Hal’s mother
to hear his story that night.</p>
<p>“Why, Mrs. Gregg’s a nice woman. Don’t
you think that I should have invited her?”
asked the Captain, with a twinkle.</p>
<p>“Oh, but you must have some other reason,”
said Bob. “You don’t want her to
come over just because you want an audience
for your story.”</p>
<p>“Well, to tell the truth,” the Captain answered,
“I have a motive. Can I count
on you to help me?”</p>
<p>“If it’s not murder,” said Bob.</p>
<p>“Nothing like it,” the Captain said. “This
is my plan, Bob. You know that we want
Hal to come along with us on our trip, now
more than at any other time. If we leave
him now, all the good that flying and being
with us has done him will be wasted, and
Hal will be the same fraid-cat that he was
before we began to educate him. Now, I’m
going to tell the story of Byrd tonight. Byrd
started on his adventures when he was very
young. He had a brave mother, who saw
that following his own inclinations was good
for her son. That much is for Mrs. Gregg.
Second—Byrd had to overcome a great many
obstacles before he reached his goal. That
part is for young Hal. Now, if the Gregg
family takes my story seriously tonight, I
think that we may have Hal with us on
our flight. And Hal will be a new boy.
How about it?”</p>
<p>Bob looked admiringly at his uncle. “Gee,”
he said, “that’s a great idea. But I think
that you’ll have to tell a pretty convincing
story.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think that I can?”</p>
<p>“Golly, I’m not going to worry about
that,” said Bob. “I’m sure you can.”</p>
<p>When they got in, they found Mrs. Martin
sewing, and lost no time in telling her
first the events of the day, and second, their
plans for the evening.</p>
<p>“But why didn’t you invite her to dinner?”
asked Mrs. Martin. “I’m sure we’d
enjoy having them with us.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think of that,” said the Captain,
“or rather, I thought that I was taking
enough liberty in just inviting somebody to
your home for the evening.”</p>
<p>“I’ll call her,” said Mrs. Martin firmly. A
far away look came into her eyes. “You
know,” she said, “I think that I shall do
some talking to Mrs. Gregg myself, I have
some things to tell her about raising her
own son. I suppose she will resent it, but
I shall at least have the satisfaction of getting
it off my chest, and perhaps of helping
poor Hal.”</p>
<p>“Hal’s the one I’m interested in,” said the
Captain. “He acted like a real hero in that
plane today. Kept his head, and saved himself
and the plane. He’s got the stuff, all
right, and he can handle a plane.”</p>
<p>“I’m with you, Captain,” said Bob. “And
with you and Mom on the job, I don’t see
how anybody can possibly get away with
anything. You two could convince anybody
of anything.”</p>
<p>His mother looked at him speculatively.
“Can I convince you right now that you
ought to go up and wash? Believe me, young
man, you can’t get away with looking that
dirty, if that’s what you mean.”</p>
<p>Grinning sheepishly, Bob went out of the
room. “You win,” he called. “And I’m
betting on you tonight, too.”</p>

<div class="section" id="chapter-viiinorth-pole-and-south">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">CHAPTER VIII—North Pole and South</a></h1>
<p>Dinner was a jolly affair. Everybody was
in excellent humor. Hal had quite recovered
from his afternoon’s experience; Pat
had succeeded in getting the Marianne into
perfect shape; Bill looked forward to his
evening’s plans with relish; and Bob was
happy just on general principles, anticipating
a great evening, and because he was usually
happy. Mrs. Gregg, who often became
lonely by herself, was glad of being in such
pleasant company.</p>
<p>They went into the garden after dinner,
and the Captain, after filling up his ever-present
pipe, began his story.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, “there’s only one way
to begin the story of anybody’s life. That’s
by telling when he was born, because after
all, that’s the first thing that happens to a
man, isn’t it? Well, Admiral Richard Evelyn
Byrd was born on October 25, 1888, in
Winchester, Virginia, where there had been
Byrds ever since anybody could remember.
In fact, the first Byrd settled in America
about 1690, and the name has been a prominent
and honored one ever since. There
were Byrds fighting in the Revolution and
in the Civil War, so it wasn’t from nowhere
that our Richard Evelyn got his courage and
grit that carried him through the dangers
of being the first man to cross both the North
and the South poles in a plane.</p>
<p>“He had a grandmother, too, who gave
him a goodly supply of what it takes to
do great deeds. That was Jane Byrd, who
was the sort of person around whom legends
spring up, and are carried down from generation
to generation. In fact, one of them
was a famous story of her killing of a huge
blacksnake. It was during the Civil War.
Her husband and her brother were both fighting
for the Confederacy, and Jane Byrd was
left alone to manage the great plantation
and farm. And manage it she did. One
day she went to gather the eggs in the chicken
house, and found a great blacksnake had
swallowed twelve prized guinea eggs that
had been set under a setting hen. She clubbed
the snake to death with a club, taking
care not to strike the twelve bumps that
showed all down its body the places where
the twelve guinea eggs reposed. Then she
cut the snake open and took out the eggs
and put them back under the hen, without
a bit of fuss or excitement. She took seriously
the charge that she must take care of the
estate while her men were away fighting.</p>
<p>“Richard Byrd couldn’t have had better
ancestors to back him up in his adventures,
but every ounce of courage, every bit of
perseverance that he inherited, he needed. He
was a man who met with hundreds of disappointments,
and innumerable obstacles in
carrying out the plans that meant so much
to him and to the world. But he was never
downed by them. Set-backs that would have
made other men, men of lesser caliber turn
from their paths and give up their plans,
were just so much more of a spur to him.</p>
<p>“Dick Byrd was never a robust man. He
had the physical handicap of a bad ankle to
overcome, and his general build has always
been slight. He is not the huge, strapping
hero of story-book fame; he was the little
Napoleon with a great determination that
outweighed any physical weakness. A man
doesn’t have to be big to get places. A little
fellow, if he wants to badly enough, can
accomplish a lot.</p>
<p>“And Dick Byrd certainly wanted badly
to go to the Pole. Even when he was a kid
in school, it was his ambition to be the first
man to reach the North Pole. Somebody
beat him to it. Peary got there first, but it
took him a long time, and he had to go on
foot. Byrd flew, and accomplished in a few
hours what had taken days and weeks to
do before.</p>
<p>“Not only did he want to go to the Pole—he
wanted to go to all sorts of places,
and he did, too. Before he was fourteen
years old, Richard Byrd traveled alone
around the world! That took nerve. And
not only nerve on Richard Byrd’s part, but
on the part of his mother! The trip wasn’t
a regular round-the-world tour that anybody
can make today on a boat that’s like a little
palace, but it was a rough, adventurous
voyage on an army transport, and a British
tramp.</p>
<p>“It was like this. You see, Dick had
struck up a friendship with Captain Kit
Carson. After the Spanish American War,
Carson went to the Philippines as a Circuit
Court Judge. But he didn’t forget his friend
Dick. They exchanged letters. In one letter
the Captain mentioned that it would be
a fine idea if Dick Byrd came down to the
Philippines to see the exciting time that they
were having down there. Dick took him up
on the idea, and made plans to go. At first
his mother was horrified at the idea, since
Dick was not a strong boy. But with unusual
intelligence, she decided to let him go,
since the trip would be an educational one,
and would do the boy more good than any
possible harm that could come to him. The
very fact that he wanted so badly to go,
and planned his trip so carefully, made her
feel that he had reached an age where he
must be allowed to decide for himself. This
was a very wise decision on her part, since
it was probably this trip, with its adventures
in self-reliance that made Richard into
the successful adventurer that he is.”</p>
<p>“The trip to Manila was made exciting by
a typhoon that stuck the transport—something
that the boy would not have wanted
to miss, although the Captain of the transport
could have done very well without it—he
said it was the worst that he’d ever been
through.</p>
<p>“They got to Manila, though, safe and
sound, and Dick was greeted by his friend
Carson. Manila was intensely amusing for
a boy of fourteen. Amusing, and mighty
exciting. The excitement included a lone
combat with a gang of angry rebels armed
with knives—from which the young Dick
escaped only by the fleetness of his pony’s
heels. That’s the sort of adventure young
boys dream of, and that’s the sort they
should have to look back on, if they are to
live the full sort of life that Richard Byrd
did.</p>
<p>“From Manila, Dick went visiting to Darim
Island. On the island the cholera plague
was raging, and Dick got exposed to the disease.
They put him into quarantine. He
didn’t get the cholera, but all around him
men were dying in terrible agony. Finally
the doctor managed to get Dick to the
seaport, and he got a boat for Manila. They
were glad to see him back, and he was glad
to be back.</p>
<p>“After Manila, Dick went on his merry
way around the world by way of Ceylon
and the Red Sea to Port Said, where he reshipped
for the last lap of his cruise. It was a
wonderful trip for a boy, and there’s no
doubt that it had a great influence on all
that he did later.</p>
<p>“When Richard got back, and had settled
down more or less, his parents decided that
he should go to Virginia Military Institute.
He was popular at the Institute, as he was
popular wherever he went, for his spirit—that
old spirit that carried him around the
world, and later across both of the earth’s
poles. It was the same spirit that made him
try out for the football team at V.M.I.—and
carried him to the position of end on
the first team. It was at that time that an
incident occurred which was to be very significant
in his later life. In one game of the
season he broke his ankle. This was not
important in itself—but it happened to be
the first break of an ankle that was going to
bother Dick again and again—and almost
at one time defeat him entirely.</p>
<p>“But I’m getting ahead of my story. After
being graduated from the Military Institute,
Dick Byrd went quite naturally to Annapolis.
He entered in 1908. He carried
his popularity and his success with him to
this place. His grades were not of the highest,
but he excelled in athletics, going out
for football again, besides track, boxing, and
wrestling.</p>
<p>“In his last year at Annapolis, Dick’s ankle
made itself felt again. Dick was Captain
of his gym squad, which was competing in
the big exhibition of the year. Dick, as
Captain, wanted to make a spectacular showing,
and cinch the meet for his team. To
do this, he invented an intricate, complicated
series of tricks on the bars, calculated to
stir up the most lethargic members of the
audience. It would have been a great trick—if
it had succeeded—but it didn’t. Dick
slipped, somehow, and his hands failed to
connect with the bars. Down he went—on
the same ankle, breaking it once more.</p>
<p>“In 1912 he got his commission, and became
an ensign. And he also began to
formulate plans for his great adventures. Connected
with the Navy—there was no telling
what opportunity for adventure would come
to him. But he reckoned without his ankle.
It gave way a third time—this time while
he was going down a gangway, so that he
was pitched headfirst down. They tried to
fix up the ankle—in fact, they joined the
bones together with a silver nail. That is,
Byrd thought that they had used a silver nail—and
when he discovered that just a plain,
ordinary nail had been used, he felt very
much deflated. Nail and all, Byrd walked
with a limp, and an ensign with a limp was
just useless, so far as the Navy was concerned.
So Byrd was retired.</p>
<p>“That must have been an awful blow to
him. Not only was the only career open to
him cut short, but he had been married the
year before, to Marie Ames, a childhood
sweetheart from Winchester. So that his retirement
affected not just himself, but another
as well.</p>
<p>“It might have floored a lesser man. But
not Dick Byrd. In 1917 the United States
went into the World War, And Byrd, who
had been rejected by the Navy, and who
doubtless could not have found a place in
the army, decided to go into the branch of
the service that wouldn’t ask questions about
his bad leg—because it didn’t matter whether
he had a bad leg or not—in aviation. So
to aviation he turned.</p>
<p>“He entered the Naval flying school at
Pensacola, Florida. It was a lucky day for
Byrd and for aviation that he took to the
air. It seems that the air was where he belonged.
He was a Byrd by birth, and might
have been born with wings, for the ease with
which he took to flying.</p>
<p>“He became assistant superintendent of the
school, and was on the commission to investigate
accidents. There were a lot of them,
then. The planes were not so highly developed
as they are now—and the green
youngsters who were entering the service
could not handle them. You can imagine
how horrible it was to see some friend’s plane
come crashing down into the ocean, and
have to be the first to go out in the rescue
boat, in order to do what was possible to
rescue him, and to discover what had caused
the accident. A warning from the observation
tower—somebody was in tailspin. A
deafening crash! And the rescue boat would
be put out before the waves from the great
splash had subsided. At this work Byrd
learned that more than half of the accidents
could have been avoided with care—either
in inspecting the machine before going up,
or in handling it up in the air.</p>
<p>“Dick Byrd was just too good. That was
his tough luck at this point in his career.
He was too good to be sent over to France,
where he wanted to go. He was sent instead
to Canada, where he was chief of the American
air forces in Canada. At this job, as
well as at any other that he undertook, Byrd
acquitted himself admirably. And even
though he chafed at being kept in America,
he did his job well.</p>
<p>“But his mind was soaring across the
ocean. As early as 1917 Byrd wanted to fly
the Atlantic. But there was always something
that interfered. After the war, he petitioned
the Navy again about a cross-Atlantic
voyage, and was given permission to go
over to England and sail the ZR-2 back to
America. How tragically this may have ended
for Byrd you can see. The ZR-2, on a
trial flight suddenly burst into flames and
crashed into the Humber river. Forty-four
of the passengers were killed, among them
friends of Byrd. It was Richard Byrd’s task
to investigate the wreck that might very easily
have claimed him for one of its victims.</p>
<p>“In 1924 his hopes seemed about to be
realized at last. He was assigned to the dirigible
Shenandoah, and was to fly it across
Alaska and the North Pole. But the Shenandoah,
too, met with disaster, and Byrd’s
hopes were again dashed. The Navy rejected
his petition to go with Amundsen on
the trip that he planned over the Pole, and
all hope seemed gone. In fact, as a final
blow, Byrd was retired from the aviation
service altogether.</p>
<p>“But he was as undaunted by this setback
as he had been by his retirement from
the Navy. He set about immediately to organize
his own Polar expedition, which was
to be climaxed by his flight over the Pole
in 1926.</p>
<p>“Floyd Bennett, whom Byrd often said
was the best man in the world to fly with,
helped him plan his expedition which was
to be the realization of all his boyhood
dreams and visions. It wasn’t easy to plan,
and the foresighted planning, they knew,
would mean the success or failure of their
project.</p>
<p>“They chose a three-motored Fokker monoplane,
with 200 horsepower Wright air-cooled
motors. It was 42 feet 9 inches long,
with a wing spread of over 63 feet. It was
capable of a high speed of 120 miles an hour.</p>
<p>“That was the plane, the Josephine Ford.
Their ship was the Chantier, given him by
the Shipping Board. The crew was made
up of picked men, and Byrd knows how to
pick them. Not one of them failed to live
up to his expectations on that trip.</p>
<p>“On April 5, 1926, all of the plans being
completed, and the last supplies of food
to last fifty men for six months being stowed
away, the Chantier sailed from New York
for King’s Bay, Spitzbergen. They got there
on April 29th, after an uneventful trip, and
anchored in the Bay. But the problem of
getting the plane to shore arose. They solved
it by building a huge raft, loading the heavy
ship onto it, and towing it to shore through
the choppy, ice-blocked water.</p>
<p>“When they got the plane onto the shore,
the wheels sank into the snow, and they had
to replace them with skis, which seemed ample
to sustain the weight of even that great
craft. How frail they really were was to be
proved later.</p>
<p>“Byrd and his men set up camp, and
prepared for the take-off to the Pole. They
had to work fast. The Amundsen-Ellsworth-Nobile
Expedition with its dirigible
the Norge was well on its way with its preparations,
and while there was no bitter rivalry
between the two expeditions, nevertheless
the distinction of being the first to fly over
the Pole was one not to be sneezed at.
Everybody worked—eighteen hours a day,
with meals taken on the run. And nobody
thought to complain—the morale never
broke once. That’s the sort of man Byrd
picks to take with him—and that’s the sort
of respect they have for a man who chooses
them. Byrd’s a leader. No matter where
he has come in contact with men, he has
won their love and respect, and has got
more work out of them by his kindness and
gentleness than anybody else could have by
slave-driving. They worked for Byrd because
they liked to, not because they had to.
He imbued them with his spirit of adventure,
so that every man of them was determined
that his expedition should be successful, and
that Byrd should be the first man to fly
across the Pole.</p>
<p>“One of the hardest jobs of all was packing
down the snow into a hard, smooth runway
for taking off. They had to take off
going down hill, since there was no level
stretch of snow for their start, and this hill
had to be smoothed and leveled. The first
attempt at a take-off was disastrous. The
plane landed in a snowdrift, with a broken
ski. The carpenters worked for two days
and nights to make new skis, and the ship
was ready for its second attempt.</p>
<p>“The second trial flight was a huge success.
The ship rolled down the incline and
took gently and gracefully into the air. At
least they would be able to get off. The
landing, too, was beautiful. So far, so good.
They discovered by this trial flight that they
could make the North Pole and return without
landing once, as they had planned before.</p>
<p>“The Josephine Ford was a mighty heavy
craft, and loaded with fuel and supplies,
which they would need in case of a forced
landing and overland trek, she weighed five
tons. This accounts for the terrible job getting
her off the ground and into the air.</p>
<p>“Well, finally everything was ready, the
weather was just right; the motors had been
warmed up, and Bennet and Byrd climbed
into the plane, ready to start. Down the
runway they coasted. There was a tense
moment. Would she lift? With a groan,
the men on the ground saw her lurch, roll
into a snowdrift, and all but turn over.</p>
<p>“A lesser man, as I said once before, would
have been discouraged. But not Byrd! He
got out, inspected the plane, and found to his
joy that it had not been damaged. No delay!
Off again. They lightened the load
as much as they dared by taking off some
fuel, then taxied the Josephine Ford up the
hill again. The men worked like Trojans
to get the runway lengthened and smoothed
out again. At last everything was ready.</p>
<p>“Byrd and Bennett decided to stake everything
on that last trial. They decided to
give the engine all the speed they could, so
that at the end of her run she’d either rise
into the air, or crack up once and for all.
Even as they planned, they hoped against
hope that it would be the former, and not
the latter. The weather was perfect. It was
a little past midnight. The men of the expedition
were gathered about, anxiously
awaiting the take-off. Byrd and Bennett
shook hands with them, stepped into the
cabin of the ship and started down the runway.
The great ship rose laboriously into
the air. There was a shout from their comrades.
They were off for the North Pole!
Those on the ground cheered lustily. The
Great Adventure, for which one of those
men in the air had been preparing all his
life, had begun.</p>
<p>“They had to navigate first by dead reckoning,
following the landmarks in the vicinity
of King’s Bay. They climbed to a good
distance so that they could get a perfect
view of the land below them, and looked
down upon the snowy mountains, scenery
grander than any they had ever seen before,
and terrifying, too. In a short time they
left the land behind, and crossed the edge of
the polar ice pack.</p>
<p>“There are no landmarks on the ice, and
when they reached the ice pack, they had to
begin their careful navigating. In the first
place, they had to hit the Pole exactly,
chiefly because that was the place they had
set out for, and then because if they didn’t
hit it exactly, they would have no way of
reckoning their path back to Spitzbergen,
and would be lost in the arctic wastes.</p>
<p>“But expert navigating was Dick Byrd’s
strong point. He had developed a sextant
by which the altitude of the sun could be
gaged without reference to the horizon line,
and that was exactly what he needed now,
because due to the formations of ice, the horizon
was irregular. But figuring out position
by means of the sextant requires at least
an hour of mathematical calculation, and by
the time the position had been figured, the
men in the airplane had advanced about a
hundred miles or more. So they used a
method that they had learned, whereby their
position could be judged by means of taking
the altitude of the sun and laying down the
line of position on a sort of graph.</p>
<p>“Their compass was of little value. They
were too near the North Magnetic Pole,
which had a tendency to pull their magnet
from the geographical Pole to its own position,
about 1,000 miles south. So they
used a sun compass, that indicated their
position by means of the sun. Of course, the
fact that they had sun throughout the whole
trip was an advantage. I doubt if they could
have made it otherwise. Navigating up there
is too difficult. Then they had to figure
on wind drift. The wind, blowing pretty
hard, say, about 30 miles an hour at right
angles to their plane would cause it to drift
thirty miles an hour out of its course. This
they were able to make up for by means of
the drift indicator, which compensated for
the drift.</p>
<p>“Bennett piloted first. He would glance
back to the cabin where Byrd was busy
with the navigating instruments, and Byrd
would indicate to him how to steer his course
by waving his hand to the right or the left.
When they were certain of their course, Byrd
looked down on the land that he had desired
to see since he had been a boy in school.
Below them, stretching for mile upon mile
was the ice pack, criss-crossed with ridges,
seeming like mere bumps in the ice from their
altitude, but really about 50 or 60 feet high.
Every now and then they saw a lead, opened
by the movement of the water—those
treacherous leads that had led many a hardy
explorer to his death.</p>
<p>“Byrd took the wheel. He steered with
one hand while he held the compass in the
other. Bennett poured gasoline into the
tanks, and threw overboard the empty cans,
to relieve the plane of weight. From then
on they took turn and turn about at the
wheel, Byrd navigating incessantly, until he
had a slight attack of snow blindness from
looking down at the snow so constantly.</p>
<p>“Soon they came to land where no man
had ever been before. It was then that Byrd
felt that he was being repaid for all the
planning, all the hard work and heart-breaking
disappointments that he had experienced.
The sun was shining, the Josephine Ford
functioning perfectly.</p>
<p>“Perfectly? Just a minute. They were
about an hour from the Pole. Byrd noticed
through the cabin window a bad leak in the
oil tank of one motor. If the oil leaked out,
the motor would burn up and stop. Should
they land? No. Why not go on as far as
they could, perhaps reach the Pole? They
would be no worse off landing at the Pole
than landing here, and they would have
reached their goal. So on they kept. Byrd
glued his eyes to the oil pressure gauge. If
it dropped, their motor was doomed. But
they would not land, or turn back.</p>
<p>“Luck was with them. At about two
minutes past nine o’clock, they crossed the
Pole. It takes just a minute to say it, but
how many years of planning, how many
years of patiently surmounting obstacles had
prepared for that minute’s statement!</p>
<p>“Below them was the frozen, snow-covered
ocean, with the ice broken up into various
formations of ice fields, indicating that
there was no land about. Byrd flew the
plane in a circle several miles in diameter,
with the Pole as a center. His field of view
was 120 miles in diameter. All this while
he was flying south, since all directions away
from the Pole are south. And now, his purpose
accomplished, his hardest task faced
him. He had to fly back to Spitzbergen.</p>
<p>“Soon after he left the Pole, the sextant
that he was using slid off the chart table,
breaking the horizon glass. He had to navigate
the whole trip back by dead reckoning!
With the oil fast spurting out, and the motor
threatening to stop any minute, and no
sextant to show his position, Byrd had his
hands full. They lost track of time. Minutes
seemed like hours, hours like ages. Then
they saw land dead ahead. It was Spitzbergen!
Byrd had flown into the unknown,
600 miles from any land, had turned about,
and come back to the very spot from which
he had started.</p>
<p>“Maybe you don’t realize what wonderful
navigating this was. But anybody who has
navigated a plane by dead reckoning knows
that it was a feat that called for great skill.</p>
<p>“Nobody was prouder of what Byrd and
Bennett had done than the men who had
worked so hard to make the trip a success,
and who had stayed behind at Spitzbergen,
without glory or reward except in knowing
that they had been a necessary feature in the
success of that journey. The whistle of the
Chantier blew a shrill whistle of welcome.
The men ran to greet Byrd and Bennett, and
carried them in triumph on their shoulders.
Among the first to greet them were Amundsen
and Ellsworth, whom Byrd had beaten
in the race to be the first to cross the Pole
by air. But they shook hands with vigor.
They were glad that it was Byrd who had
beaten them, if it had to be anybody. Byrd
affects people that way. He’s just as well
liked after successes as before them. That’s
the sort he is.</p>
<p>“They were pretty glad to see him when
he got back to the United States, too. There
were plenty of whistles blowing, plenty of
ticker tape, and parades for the returning
hero. But Dick Byrd stayed modest through
all of it. In the first place, he never gets
fussed. He isn’t a southern gentleman for
nothing. And in the second place, he realized
that the shouting wasn’t so much for
him as it was for the thing that he did. He
had brought the United States the honor of
sending the first men over the Pole. And
the United States was applauding the deed,
not himself. But he seems to have forgotten
that if it hadn’t been for his years of
planning, striving and struggling the deed
never would have been accomplished.</p>
<p>“Well, Dick Byrd had accomplished his
life’s ambition. But it didn’t mean that he
was ready to quit. There were new fields
to conquer. How about flying the Atlantic?
He’d always wanted to fly the Atlantic.
Anything that was all adventure appealed to
him. So when they hoisted anchor at Spitzbergen
after the flight across the Pole Byrd
said to his companion Bennett, ‘Now we can
fly the Atlantic.’</p>
<p>“The plan to fly the ocean had its origin
in the same motives that the North Pole
flight had. Byrd wanted to make America
aviation conscious; and he wanted to make
American aviators conscious of the benefits
of careful planning. Dozens of lives had
been lost in unsuccessful trans-oceanic flights—the
lives of young men full of the love of
adventure, who made hasty plans, or no
plans at all for spanning the ocean—who
had no qualifications except a great ambition
to see them through the great grind that
was before them. Byrd wanted to show all
fool-hardy young flyers that care, care, and
more care was needed in their preparations.
He had to prove to the United States, too,
that if care were exercised in these flights,
they were not necessarily dangerous. All this
Byrd had to prove. And in the meantime
he’d have the time of his life, steeped in the
adventurous sort of work that he craved.</p>
<p>“So Byrd and Bennett started their plans.
The first step, of course, was the choosing
of the plane. Opinion was in favor of a
single-motored plane for a cross-Atlantic
flight, since a single-motored plane would
have a greater cruising range; offer less resistance
in the air; and be less complicated
to handle than a multi-motored craft. But
Byrd held out for the tri-motor, the same
type of plane as the Josephine Ford, which
had carried him over the Pole. There was
this to say for it: if one motor stopped, the
other two would still function; and it might
be the solution to the problem of what
kind of plane would cross the Atlantic in the
future, when planes ran on regular schedule.
They wanted a bigger plane than the
Josephine Ford, though. So they had one
designed with a wing spread of 71 feet,
which meant that they got an increased lifting
power of about 3,000 pounds. That
enabled them to take along about 800 pounds
of equipment above what they actually needed,
to show that a pay load could be carted
across the water in a plane.</p>
<p>“They needed plenty of equipment,
though. There was a special radio set, rockets
to shoot off as signals if anything went
wrong; two rubber boats for the crew; and
emergency food and equipment of all sorts
for forced landings; and even a special apparatus
for making drinking water out of
salt water so that they would not go thirsty.
In fact, they could have survived for three
weeks in case of an accident. They? Why,
Byrd decided that besides himself and Bennett,
they would take along passengers, also
to prove something—this time that passengers
could be carried across to Europe by
plane.</p>
<p>“They successfully petitioned the Weather
Bureau to make predictions for the trans-Atlantic
flights, and for the first time in history
regular weather maps for aviation were
made of the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>“At the end of April, in 1927, the plane
was ready for its factory test. Byrd planned
to make his flight in May, which he figured
was a good month. It happened that there
were at the time several other planes preparing
to cross the ocean. Byrd was in no
race, however. Of course, it would have
been nice to be the first man across the Atlantic,
as he had been the first man over the
Pole—but he encouraged the others who
were preparing and made no effort to be the
first to start. However, his plane was ready
before the others.</p>
<p>“Byrd, Bennett, Noville, who was going
with them, and Fokker took her up for
her first flight. Fokker was at the controls;
the other three, passengers. Everything went
smoothly. She took off well; her motors
functioned perfectly. But as soon as the
motors were turned off for the glide, they
felt her nose dip. She was nose-heavy.
When they tried to land, they knew definitely
that she was nose-heavy, and zoomed
into the air again to plan what they should
do. However, they couldn’t stay up indefinitely—they
hadn’t much fuel. Down
they glided again. The wheels touched the
ground. Fokker jumped. But the other
three were caught.</p>
<p>“Byrd felt the fuselage heave up. The
plane went over on her nose, turned completely
over. Something struck him with
an awful impact, and he felt his arm snap.
They had to get out of this! They were
trapped in a mass of wreckage which might
at any moment burst into flames and burn
them to death before they had a chance to
escape. Noville, beside Byrd, broke a hole
in the fabric with his fist, and they crawled
out. The wreckage did not burn. Someone
had turned off the switches of all three motors.</p>
<p>“Bennett? He was hanging head down in
the pilot’s seat, unable to free himself. His
leg was broken; his face bleeding. He was
badly injured—so badly that for a week it
was thought that he would never recover.
But he did—of course. His iron nerve and
grit pulled him through. But any thought
of his going on the trip was out. This was
a blow to Byrd. There was no man he
would rather fly with than Bennett, Floyd
Bennett, the cheerful companion, the willing
worker, himself an expert pilot, and
able to divine instructions before they were
even given. Tough luck!</p>
<p>“But tough luck, too, was the fact that
the plane was almost irreparably damaged.
Byrd set his arm on the way to the hospital,
had them put it in a sling so that it would
be out of the way, and went back to the
factory to supervise the repairing of the
America. It took over a month of work
night and day to repair the damage that had
been done, and re-design the nose so that the
craft would be balanced.</p>
<p>“May 21st was set for the christening of
the plane. The christening-was changed into
a celebration of the successful flight of Lindbergh.
Bennett was pleased with Lindy’s
achievement, since Lindy had proved the
very things that Byrd himself had set out to
prove—that with careful preparation, the
ocean could be spanned; and that a successful
ocean flight would stir the imaginations
of the people, making them more conscious
of aviation and its strivings. Then, too,
Lindbergh cemented relationships between
France and the United States, which was one
of Byrd’s purposes in flying to France instead
of to England, or any other country.</p>
<p>“Well, after the ocean had been crossed,
there was no need for hurry. Not that
Byrd had been in a rush; but there was a
great deal of criticism concerning the delay
of his trip. Nobody knows how these things
start, or why. It seems that it should have
been Byrd’s, and Byrd’s business alone, as to
when he chose to cross the ocean. After all,
it was his life being risked, and his glory if
the flight were successful. But a great many
people in the United States felt that there
must be some ulterior motive in his not
starting immediately; and that he had been
bested by a mere boy when he let Lindbergh
be the first man to conquer the ocean.</p>
<p>“But Byrd didn’t care. He knew what
he was about. He was a southern gentleman,
and he said nothing to his defamers.
And he went on completing his preparations.
Chamberlin, with his passenger Levine,
broke the world’s record for flying to Germany,
in a remarkable flight. Byrd hailed
their success.</p>
<p>“Then at last, on June 29th, early in the
morning the weather man reported that
weather conditions, while not ideal, were
favorable. Dick Byrd decided to delay no
longer. He called together his crew, and
met them on the field at 3:00 o’clock in
the morning. It was a miserable morning,
and a light rain was falling. By the light
of torches the crew was putting the finishing
touches on the huge’ America. There she
was, atop the hill that they had built for
her, so that she would get a good fast start.
And a good fast start she needed, all 15,000
pounds of her. Think of the speed they had
to get up in order to lift that bulk from the
ground! They’d have to be going a mile
and a half a minute!</p>
<p>“Bert Acosta was at the wheel; Noville,
recovered from his serious injuries in the
trial crash, sat with his hand on the dump
valve, by means of which he could dump a
load of gasoline if they didn’t rise into the
air; Bert Balchen, the young Norwegian relief
pilot and mechanic, was busy with the
spare fuel.</p>
<p>“The engines were warmed up. The
great ship was ready—no, not quite ready.
But she was eager to be off. The America
broke the rope that held her, and glided
down the hill on which she had been held.
It was a tense moment. Would they be able
to get this great hulk into the air? Along
the ground she sped, gathering momentum.
Her wheels lifted. There was a shout. She
had cleared the ground. But the danger was
not over. They must fly to at least 400 feet.
Then the America showed her metal. She
climbed on a turn, and they were flying at
an altitude of 400 feet. They were off!</p>
<p>“On they sped to their destination at last.
The wind was behind them, helping them;
the weather was disagreeable, and slightly
foggy, but this did not bother them. They
reached Nova Scotia easily. But when they
got there they got a horrible shock. They
had run into a fog. But what a fog! One
so thick that they couldn’t see the land or
ocean under them. And they flew for 2,000
miles like this, absolutely blind, with black
towering clouds ahead of them, below them,
and when they ran through them, all around
them.</p>
<p>“The strain was terrible. In addition,
Byrd calculated that they had used more
fuel than he had expected, because of climbing
so high to get over the clouds, and they
might not have enough to take them to
Europe. But they did not want to turn
back. They would take their chance. Balchen
and Acosta piloted with great skill,
and Byrd took his turn at the wheel while
they slept. The wind was with them, and
they made excellent speed. Radio messages
came to them clearly. They judged their
position, and their gas supply, and found
that they had underestimated their remaining
gas. They could get to Rome.</p>
<p>“On the afternoon of the second day they
came out of the thick fog, and saw the welcome
water beneath them. They were
bound for France, and they hit the coastline
at Finisterre. They headed for Paris. Then
they radioed ahead for the weather report.
Fog! Fog and storm, with its center at
Paris. This was the worst thing that could
possibly have happened to them, this arriving
at their destination in a fog. But they went
on. It would be a triumph, and an addition
to aviation knowledge if they could
land in a storm, after coming all the way
from America.</p>
<p>“They figured finally that they must be
almost over Paris. But suddenly the fog
below them was pierced by a queer light.
It was the revolving signal of a lighthouse!
Their compass had gone back on them, and
they had made a circle, coming out not at
Paris, but back to the coast of France.</p>
<p>“They turned around, after adjusting
their compasses, and made once more for
Paris by dead reckoning. They were above
Le Bourget. But what could they do? They
could see nothing below them, only an inky
blackness that nothing could penetrate.
Landing would have meant not only death
to themselves, but perhaps to many people
who had gathered to watch their triumphal
landing. Their gas was getting low. Byrd
saw only one solution. They turned and
flew once more back to the coast. They
were heading for the lighthouse that they
had come upon accidentally before. They flew
very low, over the sleeping towns and villages
that they knew were below them, but
which were shrouded in pitch blackness. A
revolving light pierced the blackness, and
they were at the seacoast. But over the water
it was just as inky black as over the land.</p>
<p>“Balchen was at the wheel. Byrd gave
the signal to land. They threw over a line
of flares that gave them some idea as to
where to land, then descended. The force
of their impact with the water sheared off
the landing gear. The plane sank to the
wings in the water, and the fuselage filled
rapidly.</p>
<p>“Byrd was thrown into the water. He
swam to the plane. Noville was climbing
out. The other two were nowhere to be
seen. Byrd called to them. He swam over
to the plane, which was almost submerged.
Balchen was caught in the wreckage, but
managed to extricate himself. Then Acosta
swam up from nowhere. His collar bone
was broken. But a hasty survey assured
Byrd that the others were all right. Almost
exhausted, they got out the collapsible boat,
blew it up, and paddled to shore. It was
a mile to the village, and they trudged wearily
on.</p>
<p>“They certainly did not look like a triumphal
parade when they got to the village,
four tired, wet, dirty men, who looked
more like tramps than aviators. They tried
to arouse the villagers, but they could not.
A small boy riding by became frightened
when they spoke to him, and scooted away.
Finally they approached the lighthouse,
aroused the lighthouse keeper and his wife,
and made them understand what had happened.</p>
<p>“From then on, all was beer and skittles.
There wasn’t enough that the villagers could
do for the Americans who had landed so
unceremoniously in their midst—or practically
in their midst. They rescued the
plane, and the mail that was in it.</p>
<p>“Paris was next, and the real triumphal
parade started then. The flyers were almost
overwhelmed with the wonderful greeting
that the Parisians gave them. It was worth
all of the hours of agony that they had gone
through. They had accomplished what
they had set out to accomplish, after all.</p>
<p>“Then America. Once more the American
people welcomed Dick Byrd back as the
hero of the moment. He had excited interest
in aviation; he had proved many valuable
scientific facts; he had proved a hero
under trying circumstances; he had added
to the friendly feeling felt by the French for
the American people; in fact, he had done all
things except one. He had not extinguished
his spirit of adventure.</p>
<p>“No sooner was Admiral Byrd back from
his trip across the Atlantic when he was
planning another voyage, this time reflecting
again the boyish dreams of his early youth.
He planned to go to the South Pole to make
certain scientific studies, and to fly across the
Pole when he was there.</p>
<p>“Very carefully he began to plan. He
first obtained his ships. The <em>Larsen</em> and the
<em>Sir James Clark Ross</em> were to be used as supply
ships. <em>The City of New York</em>, once an
ice breaker, was to be his chief ship, and the
<em>Eleanor Bolling</em>, named in honor of his
mother, was to be the chief supply ship. He
took, too, four planes, three for observation
flights, and the huge three-motored
Fokker, the <em>Floyd Bennett</em>. Every division
of the expedition was equipped with radio
sets. Every division of the expedition was
further so equipped that in case of accident,
or in case it should be separated from any
other unit, it could rescue itself.</p>
<p>“Among the preparations was the purchase
of about a hundred eskimo dogs, which were
to be used in the arctic. Ships, planes, cameras,
radios, footgear, and a thousand other
details Byrd had to plan carefully. Almost
a million dollars had been spent before the
ships even left New York.</p>
<p>“In the midst of the preparations Admiral
Byrd received a terrible blow. This
was the death of Floyd Bennett, that someone
has already told about. Bennett flew to
the aid of Major Fitzmaurice, Captain Koebl
and Baron von Huenefeld, who had been
forced down in the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
during the first east to west crossing of the
Atlantic. At Murray Bay, Quebec, he developed
influenza, which turned into
pneumonia. He died in Quebec. Colonel Lindbergh
rushed to Quebec with serum to save
his life, but it was of no use. Floyd Bennett,
whom everybody loved, and one of the
greatest pilots of his day, had flown his last
flight.</p>
<p>“It meant a loss to all aviation, but to
Dick Byrd especially, since the two men had
been close friends. There was no man with
whom Byrd would rather have flown over
the South Pole, as he had flown over the
North. In memory of his friend, Byrd
named the plane with which he was to fly
over the Pole the <em>Floyd Bennett</em>.</p>
<p>“Preparations had to go on. It came time
to choose the crew and staff which was to
go with Byrd, to be gone for such a long
time in the arctic wastes. The prospect does
not seem inviting—the leaving of comfortable
homes, of families, in order to spend a
year in the coldest climate that will sustain
life. But so great is the spirit of adventure
in man that 15,000 people volunteered to go
on the expedition. The men who were finally
chosen were picked men—all physically
in perfect health, and mentally alert. True,
some of them shipped in positions in which
they had had no training, but Admiral Byrd
could safely say that he had made a mistake
in no case. Every man that he chose proved
himself worthy of the choice.</p>
<p>“Finally all was ready. On August 26,
1928, the <em>City of New York</em> started out.
<em>The Eleanor Bolling</em>, a steamship, started
later, as did the supply ship, the <em>Larsen</em>.
<em>The City of New York</em>, a sail boat, got to
New Zealand about the middle of November,
the last to arrive. The <em>Larsen’s</em> cargo
was shifted to the other ships. On December
2, the <em>Eleanor Bolling</em> and the <em>City of
New York</em> sailed for the ice pack. In about
two weeks it came into sight. Then the
latter ship took over the former’s cargo, and
while the sail boat sailed back for New
Zealand, the steamer went on to penetrate
the ice pack and steam at last into the Ross
Sea.</p>
<p>“The ship and its precious cargo went on
to the ice barrier, and it was on the ice barrier
that Little America, the base of the expedition,
that was to be the home of Byrd
and his men for a rigorous year and a half,
was built.</p>
<p>“The village they built was complete in
every detail. As soon as they landed, the
men started in with the building program.
There were three clusters of buildings set in
a circle about a thousand feet around. These
included the Administration Building, containing
living quarters, dispensary and radio
reception room, a meteorological shelter, etc.
Then there was the general dormitory, and
the observation igloo. Other buildings included
the store houses and medical supply
store-house; a Mess Hall, which was reached
by a tunnel, and contained the dining room,
and more living quarters.</p>
<p>“The community was a comfortable one.
There was plenty of work, of course, but
there was time for leisure, too, and the men
could listen to the radio, play with the dogs,
read one of the books of the large library;
play cards, in fact, do any one of a number
of things. The food was good. Dried vegetables
and fruits had been taken down in
quantities. There was plenty of meat, both
smoked, and fresh killed seal meat. They
had electric light, and plenty of heat to keep
them warm. In fact, the life was pleasant
if anything.</p>
<p>“Of course, the most significant part of
the whole expedition was Byrd’s flight over
the Pole. As in the other flights, the building
of the runway was the greatest task, and
one of the most important. It took the
whole crew of 60 men to keep the runway
in condition. On January 6th, the Commander
made his first flight in Antarctica,
making many photographs from his plane.
After that, many trips were taken, new land
discovered, and scientific observations made.</p>
<p>“The long night set in, and meant less activity,
but in the Spring the sun rose once
more, and activity broke out with renewed
vigor, especially around the planes. Men
had been sent ahead to cache food for
emergency, in case of a forced landing of
the <em>Floyd Bennett</em>. Byrd, Harold June,
Bernt Balchen and Ashley McKinley were to
make the flight. Everything was at last
ready, and they were waiting only for favorable
weather conditions in order to start.</p>
<p>“On November 27, this was in 1929,
came a weather report that satisfied Byrd,
no fog, and plenty of sun. The next day
was bright and fair. The plane was given
a final overhauling. It was carefully
warmed; the oil was heated and poured in.
Into the cabin went the dogs, and the dog
sledge, the food and other supplies that the
men would have to use in case of a forced
landing. Into the plane, too, went Ashley
McKinley’s camera, which was to take records
of the crossing of the Pole.</p>
<p>“Finally Byrd gave the signal. <em>The Floyd
Bennett</em> was rolled out of its hangar to the
runway. Balchen was to pilot first. He
opened the throttle of all three motors.
There was a roar, and they were on their
way.</p>
<p>“Away they flew, into the cloudless sky.
June and Balchen piloted, Byrd navigated.
They flew high, and in spite of their load
of 12,000 pounds, almost as much as they
had had on the <em>America</em>, they attained an altitude
of some 10,000 feet. This was necessary
in order to clear the highest of the
glaciers. On flew the <em>Floyd Bennett</em>, gayly
as a bird.</p>
<p>“The craft had left Little America just
before three o’clock in the afternoon. In ten
hours she had covered 700 miles. Then
suddenly they were over the Pole. They
circled around in a great circle, whose center
was the South Pole, and then turned
back. At a little after ten the next morning
they sped wearily into camp at Little America.
In nineteen hours they had been to the
South Pole and back, and Dick Byrd, even
though he couldn’t have been the first man
at the North and South Poles, nevertheless
found himself the only man in the world
who had flown over both the North and
South Poles.</p>
<p>“There was a let-down in the community’s
enthusiasm. The great task had been
accomplished. They awaited the City of
New York which was to come to take them
home. Preparations were made for the homeward
journey. It was with joyous cries
that the steamer City of New York was
greeted, and with pleasure that the men left
Little America for New Zealand. By April
they had left hospitable New Zealand behind,
too, and had started for the United
States.</p>
<p>“Once more his countrymen turned out
to honor Byrd. Dick Byrd was now Rear-Admiral
Byrd, but the same Dick Byrd as
he had always been before. There were
banquets, and medals, and many honors
heaped upon him. All over the world movies
which had been taken of the expedition
were shown to entranced millions. Everybody
shared in the work, the good times, the
adventures of that group of men.</p>
<p>“And here was little Richard Evelyn Byrd,
who had been the undersized, delicate boy,
with a will of iron, and a spirit for adventure,
the leader of it all, the prime force behind
the whole expedition. He accomplished
all that he sat out to accomplish, and more.
The scientific data that he collected proved
valuable; and interest in aviation was beyond
a doubt stimulated. And that’s that.
How’s that for a little fellow with a bum
ankle? Pretty good, eh?”</p>
<p>Nobody answered the Captain at first.
There seemed no answer. Each of them was
busy with his own thoughts. Or her own
thoughts, because the feminine minds in
that gathering were working very fast.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Martin at last, “I am
usually the last person to point a moral,
but I do think that there’s a moral in that
story.” She saw her opportunity at last.
“I think that Dick Byrd’s parents were responsible
for the boy’s success. If they had
squelched his adventurous spirit at the
beginning, he would probably never have got
any place.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Gregg smiled to herself in the darkness.
“Do you believe in young boys going
off by themselves, Mrs. Martin?”</p>
<p>“It teaches them self-reliance,” said Mrs.
Martin firmly.</p>
<p>“Do you think that they ought to fly
planes by themselves?”</p>
<p>“And why not? After all, there isn’t
very much to flying a plane, if you keep
your wits about you. And I’m sure that
both of our boys have their wits about them.
I think that the earlier you learn a thing,
the better it is for you. It makes everything
else easier, too.”</p>
<p>There was a silence for a while. Then
Mrs. Gregg said, with a laugh in her voice,
“I think that I’m being worked upon. First
by the Captain with his story, and then by
you. I’m afraid I have no defense.” She
turned to Hal, who had not spoken at all,
but who had been thinking a great deal
during the story of Byrd, and the obstacles
that he had overcome. “Well, Hal,” she
said, “what do you think? Shall we yield
to these people? Shall the Greggs yield to
the Martins?”</p>
<p>Hal had not seen his mother so light-hearted
and gay for a long time. The pleasant
evening and the story had had a decided
effect upon her.</p>
<p>Hal didn’t know exactly what to say,
But his mother went on, “I think we’re
beaten, Hal. Do you want to go to the
mountains with your friends?” Nobody
there knew the effort that that sentence cost
Mrs. Gregg, but she had said it, and she
stood committed.</p>
<p>Hal was at a still greater loss as what to
reply. His heart was beating wildly. There
was nothing that he desired more now than
to go to the mountains, but he felt the effort
that his mother had put behind her
words. Should he go? He wanted to. He
wanted to show them that he wasn’t afraid.
And he wouldn’t be afraid, either. Not any
more. Other people, little fellows, too, had
done things, had gone places, and they
weren’t afraid. So Hal said, “Well, I’d like
to.”</p>
<p>“If you wish to, you may,” said Mrs.
Gregg.</p>
<p>Bob, who had listened breathlessly to this
conversation, could restrain himself no longer.
“Whoopee!” he yelled. “Hal’s coming
along! Hal’s coming along!” He jumped
up and started to execute a war dance, dragging
Hal after him.</p>
<p>Captain Bill was pleased. His story had
made a hit—more of a hit than he had even
hoped for.</p>

<div class="section" id="chapter-ixfour-women-flyers">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">CHAPTER IX—Four Women Flyers</a></h1>
<p>Mrs. Martin, too, was pleased. She had
gained her point, and now had another surprise
for the company. “Did it ever occur
to you that there are famous flyers who aren’t
men? It’s just like you to neglect the women
altogether.”</p>
<p>“Aw,” said Bob, “we can’t go telling
stories about women. We’re sticking to
men.”</p>
<p>“It seems to me that the women oughtn’t
to be neglected,” said his mother. “After
all, when we women do things, we like to
be recognized.”</p>
<p>The Captain broke in, then. “Well, how
about some of the women? he asked. Of
course, being a woman yourself, you can’t
enter our story-telling contest, but you can
amuse us from a purely amateur love of
getting in your feminine licks.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin smiled in the dark. “You
think that I won’t,” she said. “But I will.
I’ve been doing reading of my own, you
know.”</p>
<p>“Tell away, Mater,” said Bob. “You’re
better than any of us.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin began her story. “There are
four women who stand head and shoulders
above the rest in the United States,” she
said, “when it comes to flying. They are
that oddly-assorted group—tall, slender,
boyish Amelia Earhart, who’s Amelia Earhart
Putnam, now; little Elinor Smith, who
doesn’t weigh much over a hundred pounds:
medium-sized, gracious and charming Ruth
Nichols, who belongs to the Junior League;
and short, sturdy, daring Laura Ingalls.</p>
<p>“Amelia is probably the first lady of the
land, or I should say, first lady of the air
in the United States now, since her solo
trans-Atlantic flight on May 20, 1932. It
was fitting that she should make her flight
on the fifth anniversary of Lindbergh’s flight
to Europe, because she’s always been called
the Lady Lindy. She looks like him, you
know—long, lean, blonde, with a shock of
unruly curly hair, and a shy, contagious
smile. She has even his modest nature, and
the ability to win the hearts of everybody
with whom she comes in contact.</p>
<p>“The solo flight wasn’t Amelia Earhart’s
first trip across the ocean by plane. You
remember her first flight, when she went as
a passenger on the Stultz-Gordon flight in
1928. She’s the first person now who has
ever crossed the ocean twice through the
air. Amelia is a real pioneer—she must
have adventure and excitement in life—that’s
why she gave up social service work,
and made flying her profession. It wasn’t
easy for her to learn to fly—she just had
evenings and Sundays to get in her practice
flights, but she stuck to it, and finally had
a sufficient number of hours in the air to
get her pilot’s license. Of course, she is interested
in the progress of aviation. Everybody
who flies has this interest at heart—but
the love of adventure is uppermost in
her mind when she makes her record flights.</p>
<p>“It was that that sent her across the
Atlantic, through storms and sleet and fog,
with no thought of turning back, in spite
of decided defects in her motor that threatened
to land her in the middle of the ocean
and send her to certain death.</p>
<p>“There wasn’t much publicity before her
flight. Since it was going to be for her own
satisfaction, she wanted to keep it to herself.
She took off quietly from Harbor Grace,
Newfoundland. The weather was fairly
good, but when she got out a few hours,
she met with the same terrifying flying conditions
that her solo predecessor, Lindbergh,
had. Fog enveloped her plane. She could
not see in front of her, or to either side.
Ice formed on the wings of her plane, and
threatened to break them off. Gradually the
temperature rose, and the ice melted. But
new dangers threatened. A weld in the exhaust
manifold broke, and the manifold vibrated
badly; leaks sprang in the reserve gas
tanks in the cockpit, and then—the altimeter
broke.</p>
<p>“Now the altimeter, as I suppose you all
know, records the altitude at which the plane
is flying. Amelia Earhart had never flown
without one, and now she realized the hazards
of not knowing how high she was flying
through the fog. Sometimes she would
drop so low that she came suddenly out of
the fog, but so close to the water she could
see the white caps on the surface.</p>
<p>“The girl realized that she must make a
landing as soon as possible, and that was
when she reached Culmore, Ireland, a tiny
place five miles from Londonderry. She
landed in a field, scaring a team of plow
horses, who had never before seen a woman
landing after a trans-Atlantic flight. She
went by automobile to Londonderry, and
there received the rousing welcome that was
due her.</p>
<p>“Europe entertained her royally. She was
awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross; she
was received by the Prince of Wales; she
was partied and banqueted. And through
it all she kept her poise, and modestly accepted
the acclaim that was showered upon
her. She was the first woman to fly solo
across the Atlantic, but not only that, she
had set a new speed record for the North
Atlantic Ocean, flying a distance of 2,026
miles in about thirteen and a half hours.
She had at the same time broken Ruth Nichols’
long distance record for women, which
had been set at 1,977 miles from Oakland,
California, to Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
<p>“Ruth Nichols has a habit of setting records.
She started to fly at about the same
time that Amelia Earhart started, and has
kept nip and tuck with her, except for the
fact that proposed plans of hers to fly the
Atlantic have not as yet been carried out.
She was graduated from Wellesley College,
and was a member of the Junior League,
which rates her pretty high in the social
scale, but her overwhelming desire for adventure
and pioneering, led her, as it led
Amelia Earhart, to choose aviation as her
profession. Ruth Nichols held the long distance
record for women until it was broken
by Amelia Earhart. She holds the altitude
record for women, though, and broke the
altitude record for Diesel engines in 1932, at
a height of over 21,000 feet.</p>
<p>“Elinor Smith was, in a way of speaking,
born in an airplane cockpit. Her father
was a pilot; Elinor made her first flight
as a passenger at the age of eight; took over
the controls at twelve; and made her first
solo flight at fifteen. She was so small that
her head did not reach over the top of the
cockpit, and the other pilots called her ‘the
headless pilot.’ It was a funny sight to see
a plane land gracefully on a field apparently
with no one to guide it. Then out would
pop Elinor, a grimy little girl, covered with
grease from the motor, and with a cheerful
grin on her impish face. It was Elinor,
who at seventeen, set the women’s solo endurance
record by staying in the air alone
for 26 hours and 21 minutes. Elinor should
do great things in aviation. She knows her
planes inside and out; she’s had the opportunity
such as no other woman has had, to
learn the technicalities of aviation when she
was young that she absorbed them as part
of herself. Elinor Smith is one of the most
popular women in aviation now.</p>
<p>“Laura Ingalls is the stunt flyer of the
women. She came out of the middle-west,
from Missouri. She took to music and dancing
first to express her restless spirit, and
then found that it was flying that would
express her best. So she went to a government-approved
school, and became an expert,
daring flyer. She is the holder of the record
for loop-the-loops for women, and of the
barrel roll record for both men and women.
She is interested in the progress of aviation,
but gets a great thrill out of merely flying
for its own sake.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin paused. “I guess that gives
you an idea,” she said, “what women are
doing nowadays.”</p>
<p>“Women have always done the great
things in aviation,” said Mrs. Gregg. “They
stay home and wait while the men are risking
their lives. Waiting is harder than doing.</p>
<p>“Women haven’t a monopoly on that,”
said Bob. “What about Mr. Putnam, who
waited at home while his wife flew the
ocean?”</p>
<p>Everybody laughed. “You’re right, Bob,”
said Mrs. Gregg. Then she added, “It’s getting
pretty late. How about our going,
Hal?”</p>
<p>The two of them cut across the garden
to their home.</p>

<div class="section" id="chapter-xhawks-and-doolittle">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">CHAPTER X—Hawks and Doolittle</a></h1>
<p>The next day was spent in a pleasantly
muddled state, getting Hal ready to go with
them, and putting the finishing touches to
their own equipment. Stout boots, fishing
lines, flies, everything on their lists was gradually
being checked off. Late in the afternoon
they had a breathing space, and Bob
remembered that it was Pat’s turn to tell
his story.</p>
<p>“Come on, Pat, you might as well get it
over with,” said Bob. “We haven’t anything
else to do, anyway.”</p>
<p>“You’re mighty impudent for a young
one, Bob, my lad,” said Pat. “Just
because you’ve made a solo flight doesn’t mean
that you’re wings are dry yet. You might
know that any story I’d tell would be good.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Patrick, you’ll have to prove that,”
said the Captain. “I’ve heard some pretty
awful ones from you. Haven’t I?”</p>
<p>“It must have been two other fellows,”
said Pat. “But I’ll begin. And I won’t
take so long, either. I’m not one of these
long winded story tellers,” he said significantly.</p>
<p>“Get on, get on.” This from Captain
Bill.</p>
<p>“My two boys are the speedy two, all
right,” began Pat. “Speed was their middle
name. Their real names were—well, you
probably have guessed. It’s not a secret—Frank
Hawks and Jimmie Doolittle. Beg
pardon, maybe I had better say Lieutenant
Commander Frank Hawks of the United
States Naval Reserve, the holder of some 30
inter-city aviation records, etcetera, etcetera;
and maybe it would be more proper to talk
about James Doolittle, M.S.; D.A.E.. But
what’s the use of the titles? They’re just
Frank and Jimmie, two of the squarest
shooters in the game.</p>
<p>“Frank was born, of all places for a flyer
to be born, in Marshalltown, Iowa, on
March 28, 1897. Iowa’s flat, you know.
Wouldn’t think that there’d be much inspiration
for flying out there. But maybe
all that flat prairie was just so much inspiration
to get away from it all, and get
up into the air. Anyway, young Frank
put plenty of grey hairs in his mother’s head
with his love for climbing. Just crazy about
high places. Always up a tree, so to speak.</p>
<p>“Little Frank was mighty pretty, I guess.
Maybe he wouldn’t like my saying it, but he
must have been a smart kid, too. At a very
tender age, my lads, our friend Frank Hawks
was playing children’s parts in Minneapolis.
But then the family moved to California—maybe
to live down the scandal of a performing
son, and Frank got serious, being
mightly busy just going to high school.</p>
<p>“Maybe it was fate, but something happened
that changed Frank Hawks’ ideas
about what he wanted to be when he grew
up. The Christofferson brothers, who were
pretty great shakes in those days, and pioneers
in flying, set up a shop on the beach
outside Frank’s home town. They took
up passengers. But they charged plenty for
it, and Frank, while he hung around a lot,
never had the money to go up, although he
was mighty anxious to fly.</p>
<p>“Finally he got an idea. If he couldn’t
get up in the usual way, he’d find a way he
could go up. So young Frank got himself a
pencil, a notebook, and a mighty important
look, and approached one of the Christoffersons.
‘I'm from the newspaper, Mr. Christofferson,’
he says, ‘and I’d like an interview
with you.’ And he interviewed him
just as serious as you please, with Christofferson
pleased as could be, thinking of the
publicity and the new passengers he’d get.
Then young Frank asked if he couldn’t go
up, in order to write his impressions of an
airplane ride. Of course, of course.</p>
<p>“So Frank Hawks got his first ride in an
airplane, and decided on his future career.
Aviation got a recruit and Christofferson
waited a long time for his interview to appear.
In fact, he waited indefinitely.</p>
<p>“The problem for Frank then was to
get another ride. He finally went to the
flyer, and told him what he had done. He
was forgiven, and worked out his passage
for that ride and other rides by working
around the flying field. It was then he
learned to fly. But business was not too
good, and the brothers moved on. Frank
Hawks went on with his high school work,
and was graduated in 1916. Thought he
ought to have more book learning, so he
went on to the University of California.</p>
<p>“But the war stopped that. When he was
twenty, Hawks joined the army, the Flying
Corps. He was too good, though. Too
good for his own good. They never sent
him to France, where he wanted to go. Instead,
they made him an instructor, so that
he could teach green recruits how to fly. At
the end of the war he was discharged, with
the title of Captain.</p>
<p>“The five years after that were hectic ones.
Aviation was still new—interest in it had
been stirred up by war flying, and all sorts
of men, young, old, every kind, bought up
old planes from the government and went
barnstorming around the country, taking
people up on flights, stunting, flying in air
circuses, balloon jumping, and doing anything
they could to make money with their
tubs. Some of these planes were no more
than old junk, and the flyers no more than
the rankest amateurs. But there were some
of them who were good, and one of these
was Hawks. He went dizzily stunting around
the country, until’ he got himself the reputation
of being just plain crazy, but a great
flyer.</p>
<p>“There were ups and downs, to be sure.
And I don’t mean to be funny, either, my
lads. The people in the United States
were getting just a little weary of going up
in airplanes just for the fun of the thing—they
were getting too common. But—there
were people down in Mexico who had never
seen a plane, much less flown in one, so
down to Mexico went Hawks. He gave.
Mexico plenty of thrills, and Mexico gave
him some, too. The country was unsettled
at the time, upset with revolutions. Hawks
got a job flying a diplomat from Mexico
City to his ranch, because they’d be safer in
the air than going by automobile through
the mountains. Hawks even tried ranching
for a while, but it didn’t work.</p>
<p>“He decided to go back to the United
States, and when he went back he married
Edith Bowie, who hailed from Texas. Down
in Texas Hawks flew over the cotton fields
with arsenic to kill the boll weevils. He
worked in the oil fields, too, as a driller. It
was good experience for him. They found
out that he could fly, and he got a job piloting
officials of the oil company from place
to place in the oil country. They found that
they were saving time and money.</p>
<p>“At this time Lindy flew over the Atlantic.
Hawks bought the Spirit of San Diego,
which was the sister ship to the Spirit of
St. Louis, and flew across the country to
greet Lindbergh when he came back. He flew
4,000 miles on a National tour with the
Spirit of San Diego, and then 7,000 miles
criss-cross.</p>
<p>“Luck was with him. He was going to
reap his just rewards. He became a member
of one of the country’s richest oil companies,
as their technical flying expert. He advised
them in buying planes, and chose their pilots
for them, and in addition, had to sell flying
to the country.</p>
<p>“And maybe he didn’t set out in earnest
to make the country sit up and take notice
then! There was a Wasp-motored Lockheed
Air Express monoplane at the
manufacturers’ in Los Angeles, and it had to be flown
to New York. Hawks got the bright idea
that he could fly it across the country without
a stop. And he did.</p>
<p>“It was his first cross-country flight, and
his hardest. In the first place, it was February,
and the weather was pretty bad for
flying—so uncertain that they couldn’t predict
what he’d run into. But he decided to
take his chance. This was in 1929. Of
course, its being 1929 didn’t make it any
harder, but I just thought I ought to tell
you what year it was. The start from Los
Angeles wasn’t bad. He had a mechanic
with him to keep filling the gasoline engines,
a fellow by the name of Oscar Grubb. They
hadn’t flown for very long when they ran
into a fog. Hawks thought he’d try flying
below the ceiling—but he ran into a snow
storm. Then he tried climbing above it.
He couldn’t get over it.</p>
<p>“And in the midst of all this terrible strain
of flying through fog so thick that he couldn’t
see the nose of his plane, the engine began
to miss. The tank was empty. He
switched on the other tank. It was empty,
too. Why hadn’t Oscar warned him that
the fuel supply was out? What had happened
to it? Hawks looked back. There
was Oscar, sprawled out, fast asleep. But he
woke up. Pretty lucky for Oscar Grubb
that he did, and typical Hawks luck. The
tanks were filled, and on they flew through
the murk and fog. The fog cleared a little
when they got to Kentucky, but Hawks
didn’t know where he was, anyway. It
wasn’t until they got to Washington that
he recognized his position, by the Capitol
dome. From there he sped to New York,
where everybody was glad to see him. No
wonder. This speedy gentleman had made
the trip in 18 hours, 21 minutes, breaking
all speed records then existing for non-stop
cross country flight.</p>
<p>“It got to be a habit, this record-breaking.
His next venture was New York to Los
Angeles and back. He left Roosevelt field at
8 o’clock in the morning, and was in Los
Angeles in the evening. Seven hours later
he turned back and in 17½ hours more he
was back again at Roosevelt field. It was
dark coming down, and he broke a wing,
but he escaped unhurt. He’d broken the
east-west, west-east, and round trip records,
all of them, making the round trip in 36
hours and 48 some minutes.</p>
<p>“Hawks never let people forget him for
long. He was out to sell speed to the country,
and he knew that the way to do it was
by speeding. In July everybody began to
hear about the ‘mystery ship’ that was being
built for him. It was a monoplane. On
August 6th, it was a mystery no longer.
Hawks was going to race with the sun. The
sun had always beaten him so far, and he
wanted a return match, for revenge.</p>
<p>“So he lifted his monoplane into the air
in New York, just as the sun was rising, at
about 6 in the morning. He flew right with
that sun and got into Los Angeles before
it had set, or just about 10 minutes before
6 o’clock in the evening. He’d beaten dat
ol’ davil sun, all right. One week later, and
he was on his way back across the continent
again, and got to New York in less than
12½ hours.</p>
<p>“Well, he’d proved how quickly you
could get across the United States in an ordinary
plane. Then he showed how you
could cross with a glider, towed by an engined
plane. Why, you ask. Well, in the
first place, it attracted attention to gliders.
And gliders are important in aviation. And
then, if towed gliders are practical, they
might solve the problem of carrying pay
loads in cross-country flights. The glider
could be loaded up, hitched to an airplane,
and go from New York to any point west.
That was the idea. Well, Hawks did attract
attention. It took him six and a half days
to get from San Diego to New York, stopping
off at a lot of cities, and just generally
bumming around the country.</p>
<p>“In 1930 about the only spectacular flight
that Frank Hawks made was the tour with
Will Rogers, when they flew around the
country seeking help for the drought victims.
They covered 57 cities in 17 days, which
meant a lot of work, because they put on a
show wherever they stopped. Hawks, with
his stage experience behind him, fitted in
perfectly with the plan. He not only could
fly, but he developed a patter, modeled after
Will Rogers’ and came out chewing gum
and swinging a lariat.</p>
<p>“In 1931, having about exhausted record-breaking
in the United States, our friend
Mr. Hawks left these shores, and went off
to Europe to sell speed and airplanes to that
continent. No sooner had he landed than he
started to break their records, too. The
first one to fall was the speed record from
London to Berlin, a distance, of 600 miles,
which he made in 2 hours and 57 minutes.
This was just about half the time that the
regular passenger planes take. He had a light
tail wind behind him, to help him, and a
bad fog over the channel to hinder him. He
flew the whole distance by compass.</p>
<p>“About a week later the United States
again heard from Frank Hawks. They
heard that he’d dined in three European
capitals on the same day. Left Bourget before
breakfast, had breakfast in London,
kippers, I suppose, or kidneys, at the Croydon
Field. That was about 9:30. He left
Croydon for Berlin, and got there 3 hours
and 20 minutes later, in time for lunch at
the Tempelhof Airdrome. He flew back to
Paris, for tea at Le Bourget, and then
motored into the city for a good dinner.
The dinner he didn’t pay for. It was on
some friends who had bet him that he
couldn’t make it. He did. Don’t bet against
Frank Hawks. It isn’t good business.</p>
<p>“The next month, on June 17, Frank
felt hungry again, and maybe tired of the
food he’d been getting, anyway. So he got
into his plane, at London, just after breakfast;
had luncheon in Rome, and got back
in time for tea in London. He’d made the
round trip in 9 hours and 44 minutes, actual
flying time. Of course, a man has to
take time out to eat. Getting to Rome and
back meant that he’d beaten the Alps twice.
He enjoyed that trip. He’d had a head wind
with him all the way, and was pretty glad
about beating the Alps. They look less
mighty and dangerous when you’re looking
down at them from a safe plane, in the cleat
sunshine. Almost gentle.</p>
<p>“Speedy Hawks decided to come back to
America. But he didn’t come back to rest.
He went right on breaking records, and making
up new ones to be broken. In January
of 1932 he flew from Agua Caliente to Vancouver,
British Columbia, in 13 hours and
44 minutes. That was called his famous
three-flag flight. It was a grand flight, too,
and the first of its kind to be flown in one
day. It wasn’t non-stop; he’d stopped at
Oakland, California and Portland, Oregon,
both on the way up and the way back, for
fuel. The trip was about 2,600 miles long,
and he’d averaged about 180 miles per hour.</p>
<p>“Hawks is certainly accomplishing what
he set out to do. He’s never had to bail
out, and he’s never had a serious accident.
He was pretty well banged up when he
didn’t clear the ground and crashed into
some wires early in 1932, but he pulled out
of that all right. Flying fast was no more
dangerous than flying slowly, if a man could
handle his plane. What the country needed
was speed and more speed, and Hawks gave
it to them. It helped, too. The whole
commercial system in the United States has
speeded up. Two hours have been cut off
the transcontinental trip, and more will undoubtedly
be cut off. In June of ’32 Hawks
was made Lieutenant Commander Hawks.
And it’s no more than he deserves. He’s
a great lad.</p>
<p>“And so is Jimmie Doolittle. There’s some
say that Jimmie is the greatest flyer of them
all, but he says he isn’t. I don’t know
whether we should take his word for it or
not. He may be prejudiced. Anyway, he’s
one of the best liked flyers in the country.
James Doolittle is a little fellow. That
is, he’s short. Just 5 feet 2, but every inch
a scrapper, and every inch nerve.</p>
<p>“Anybody who talks about Doolittle
likes to tell the story of the time he went
down to Chile for the Curtiss Company to
demonstrate a new type of flying plane to
the government. The Chilean government
was pretty particular. It wanted only the
best, so it decided to have five countries compete
in a mock fight, England, France, Germany,
Italy and the United States, and the
plane that won the battle would be the one
bought for the Chilean army.</p>
<p>“Well, Curtiss asked the Army Air Service
if they could borrow the Army’s crack
test pilot, Jimmie, and the Army lent him.
Doolittle went down there all set to win.
But there was a party for the aviators before
the battle, and the aviators, all being young,
and good fellows, got very jolly, and decided
that each of them would have to put
on a stunt to entertain the others. Now
Doolittle decided that his best bet was acrobatics,
so he balanced on the window ledge,
to show his best handstands and other tricks
that he’d learned in college. A brace or
something on the window gave way, and
down went James into the street, landed on
both feet, and broke both ankles. Just before
the big show! Well, they took him to
the hospital and put both ankles in a plaster
cast.</p>
<p>“The show went on, and the hero wasn’t
there. But was he resting peacefully at the
hospital? He was not. With the help of a
friend, he cut off the plaster cast, had himself
hoisted into an ambulance, and taken
to the field. When he got there, they strapped
his feet to the rudder bar, and he was all
set to go into his act. Only the German plane
was in the air. Doolittle zoomed up, and
there followed one of the prettiest dog fights
that anyone there had ever seen. Doolittle
maneuvered and bedeviled that German
plane until it turned tail and retired. James
circled around once or twice to show that
he was cock of the walk, and then came
down to get the Chilean contract for the
Curtiss people. That’s the way James Doolittle
does things.</p>
<p>“How did he get so scrappy? Well, he was
a born fighter. And then, he grew up in a
gold camp in the Klondike, and if there was
any place harder than a gold camp in Alaska
in those days, it would be hard to find. Jimmie
was born in Alameda. California, in
1896. His father was a carpenter and miner,
and left for the Klondike in ’97, the year
before the big rush to Dawson in ’98. Well,
two years later he sent for his wife and the
boy James.</p>
<p>“Jimmie’s first scrap was with an Eskimo
child. He drew blood, and was so frightened
that he cried as loudly as the Eskimo warrior.
But he never stopped fighting after
that first fight. Maybe it was because he was
so small that he had to fight. Anyway, he
usually was fighting boys bigger than himself,
and he got so good that he’d whip them
to a frazzle every time. It gets to be a
habit, you know, and any way, he was born
scrappy. Ask anyone.</p>
<p>“The Doolittles left the Klondike, and
moved back to California with their obstreperous
son, and I imagine the Klondike
parents breathed a little easier. In California
Jimmie went to school, and on the side became
Amateur Bantamweight Champion of
the Pacific Coast.</p>
<p>“When he’d been graduated from High
School Jimmie went on to the University of
California, same college that Hawks had attended.
He went on fighting, still in the bantamweight
class. But one day down in the
gymnasium, the boxing coach put him in
the ring with a middleweight for some practice.
Jimmie knocked him out. And he
knocked out the second middleweight, and
the third middleweight. So the coach, seeing
that he had struck gold, entered Jimmie in
the match with Stanford, but in the middleweight
class. The crowd roared when they
saw the little bantam getting into the ring
with a pretty husky middle. The middleweight
thought that it was a joke on him,
and was careful not to hit hard. But he
needn’t have been so kind. Jimmy Doolittle
retaliated by knocking him stiff and cold in
a few minutes.</p>
<p>“Jimmie didn’t graduate. In 1917 he married
Jo, and settled down to serious things,
such as going out to Nevada and becoming
a gold miner, and later a mining engineer.
I might say a word about Jim and Jo.
They’re known as the inseparables. They’re
always together. They’ve got two kids, who
are thirteen and eleven years old, and who
can fly in their daddy’s footsteps. The family
leads a gypsy life, flying from one army field
to another, but they have a great time.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m getting ahead of my story.
Let’s get back to the War. Because the war
broke out then, you know, and Jimmie
joined the air service. His first lesson, they
turned him over to an instructor by the name
of Todd. They were still on the ground,
when they heard a crash, then another crash.
Two planes had collided in the air. First
one dropped, then the other, close to Jimmie’s
plane. One of the pilots was killed;
the other pilot and his passenger were badly
hurt. Doolittle helped them out, and went
back for his first lesson.</p>
<p>“Jimmie, like Hawks, was just too good.
They didn’t send him to France at all, but
made him an instructor at Rockwell Field,
San Diego, where he became known as one
of the star aviators in the air service. He was
pretty angry when he found that he couldn’t
go to France. He went out to relieve his feelings.
He picked out an innocent soldier walking
down the road, and made for him. He
didn’t have any grudge against that soldier,
just against the world. But that soldier had
to bear the brunt. Jimmie swooped down
on him. The soldier wouldn’t move out of
the way or flatten out. Jimmie swooped closer
and closer. The soldier stood his ground.
Finally Jimmy came so close that his wheels
nicked the soldier, and down he went. And
away flew Jimmie, but so low that he couldn’t
rise again in time to clear a barbed wire
fence at the side of the road. He got caught
in the fence and smashed up. They gave
him a month in the barracks to think over
how smart-aleck he’d been, and then Jimmie
was out again. The soldier had a bump
on the head to remind him that he’d been
in the way when Jimmie Doolittle was mad.</p>
<p>“Jimmie had other crashes. One was just
before he made his famous flight in 1922
across country from Pablo Beach to San
Diego. On his first attempt at a take-off one
of his wheels struck some soft sand, and
over he turned, being thrown into the water,
plane and all. His second take-off was more
successful—in fact, it was perfect. He got
to San Diego in 22½ hours.</p>
<p>“Jimmie’s greatest achievements have been
in testing and experimenting. After the war
he went to the Army technical school at
Dayton. He got an honorary degree from
the University of California, and then he
went to Boston with Jo, and entered the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
With Jo’s help he did four years’ work in
three, and got the degrees of Master of
Science, and Doctor of Aviation Engineering—the
first flyer to get the D.A.E. degree
there.</p>
<p>“He resigned from the army to join the
Shell Petroleum Corporation, Curtiss borrowed
him again, though, and he went to
Europe to demonstrate speed planes for Curtiss
to 21 European governments. He’s a
marvellous tester. He got the D.F.C. for his
transcontinental flight. In 1925 he got the
Schneider Cup in the International races,
and in 1929 the medal of the Federale Aeronautique
Internationale for his outstanding
achievements in aviation.</p>
<p>“I haven’t told you the most outstanding,
feats, Doolittle was one of the pioneers in
blind flying. He experimented for the Guggenheim
Foundation, testing instruments to
be used for blind flying. He also tested the
stress and strain that flying has on the human
body. He would go into right spirals,
risking his life, in order to see under what pressure
a man becomes unconscious. It’s a
dangerous business, but great for aviation.</p>
<p>“In September, 1931, Doolittle won the
air derby, flying from Los Angeles to New
York to establish a new transcontinental
West to East record on 11 hours and 15
minutes. He won at the same time the Los
Angeles-Cleveland Bendix trophy when he
crossed the finish line of the National Air
Races at the Cleveland airport. His time to
Cleveland was 9 hours and 10 minutes, an
average speed of 223 miles per hour. As if
that wasn’t enough, he flew back to St.
Louis to sleep, making a trip of 3,300 miles
in 19 hours. He’d broken Hawks’ record
then standing. Both the boys are still going
strong. You never knew when you’re going
to wake up and find that one of them has
flown across the country so fast that he
ended up right where he started from, only
two hours earlier. But now I’m getting fantastic,”
said Pat. “I must be getting tired,
and no wonder. It’s time we were getting to
bed, if we want to leave at any hour tomorrow.”</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">CHAPTER XI—Hal Comes Through</a></h1>
<p>The day of their departure dawned bright
and clear. There was a high ceiling, the air
was crisp and cool, with a fresh wind blowing.
The boys could hardly control themselves
in their impatience to be off. Bob’s
parents and Mrs. Gregg drove down to the
airport with them to see them off. In spite
of the excitement of the boys, there was an
undercurrent of restraint in the group. Nobody
talked very much except Bob and Hal,
who never stopped talking.</p>
<p>The cabin plane had been taken out and
warmed up by the mechanics of the port.
It looked sleek and beautiful in the early
morning light. Pat was going to fly her.
He walked over to the Administration
Building to make final arrangements with their
friend Mr. Headlund. He took a short
cut across the field. The port wasn’t very
busy. But there was some activity—activity
that Pat, intent upon his business, did not
notice. A student pilot, taxiing his plane
across the field for his first solo flight, was
coming straight toward him. Pat did not
notice the student, the student was too rattled
to see him.</p>
<p>Bob was the first to notice what was happening.
“Look put!” he screamed. “Pat,
look out!”</p>
<p>The student pilot suddenly saw Pat. He
veered his plane, but a corner of the wing
just grazed Pat’s head, and knocked him flat.
He was already getting to his feet when the
others got to him.</p>
<p>“Are you hurt, old fellow?”</p>
<p>Pat was rubbing his head. “No, I don’t
think so. That is, no, I’m not at all. Just
nicked me. I’ll be all right in a second.” He
shook his head to clear it. “Gave me a bit of
a bump. I’ll be all right.”</p>
<p>The student pilot, white and shaking,
came over to them. “Hurt badly?” he asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>Pat laughed. “No such luck, lad. You
missed me that time. Better luck next time.
You might try picking on somebody who’s
not so tough, next time.”</p>
<p>Pat was himself again, and the others,
thankful that he had not been seriously
hurt, watched him go into the Administration
Building. When he came out, Bill asked.
“Do you want me to pilot?”</p>
<p>Pat looked scornful. “Since when did a
little bump on the head put me out of commission?
I’m driving the bus.”</p>
<p>All the baggage stowed away, the boys,
the Captain and Pat got into the plane.
They waved good bye to the others outside,
the huge craft taxied over the field, turned
into the wind and rose into the air. It was
pleasant being off at last. There was the
grand trip before them, and then the vacation
itself, fishing, swimming, shooting.
Hank had filled their heads full of the glories
of his private mountain, as he called it.
The cabin with its huge open fireplace built
of stones, the bunks in two tiers like the
berths on a pullman. Bob and Hal had already
decided that they would have to take
turns sleeping in the upper one, because
surely the upper one would be the most fun.</p>
<p>Their thoughts kept returning to the cold
mountain streams filled to the brim with
scrappy fish, and the waterfall that Hank
said he used as an outdoor shower. A whole
month of it! The boys could hardly sit still
on the leather cushions.</p>
<p>“Want something to eat?” said Bill.</p>
<p>“Of course,” they said, almost together.</p>
<p>Bill reached for the lunch hamper. Then
something seemed to go wrong. The plane
lurched. But they hadn’t struck an air pocket.
It’s nose fell, and the three were almost
thrown into a heap, one atop the other. The
plane was going into a spin! Beyond the
glass partition, Pat lay slumped over his
wheel.</p>
<p>Something had to be done at once. And
it was Hal who did it. He pushed open the
glass partition, and got somehow to the
pilot’s seat. With all his strength, and his
excitement gave him a strength that he had
never before possessed, he pulled Pat out of
his seat, and pushed him through the door,
where the Captain and Bob were waiting to
take him. Hal slipped behind the wheel, and
neutralized all controls.</p>
<p>Thank God, they had been flying at a high
altitude. The spin wasn’t a tight one, but a
loose one. Hal pushed her nose down. That
was what Pat had told him, wasn’t it?
Don’t try to pull her nose up. Push it down,
and she’d come out of it and go into a glide.
At first nothing happened. Hal was trembling,
not so much with fear as with exaltation.
He felt the great ship respond. They
were coming out of it! They were gliding
swiftly down to earth. He had her perfectly
under control. Slowly he pulled her up,
then, and they were flying quietly and steadily
with the horizon again.</p>
<p>The Captain was at the door behind him.
“You’re great, Hal, you’re great. You had
more guts than any of us. I knew you had
it in you, and you’ve showed us, Hal.”</p>
<p>Hal was happier than he had ever been
in his life. He felt that he was master of
the world now. He’d saved his pals, and
now he would never have to be afraid of
anything again. “How’s Pat?” he asked.</p>
<p>“We’re turning around. He hasn’t come
to,” said the Captain. “I’m afraid he was
hurt more badly than he thought.”</p>
<p>Hal banked and turned. It was good to
feel the ship respond to him, dipping one
huge wing slowly, and turning about gracefully
in a great circle. If not for Pat, his
happiness would have been complete.</p>
<p>They got Pat to the hospital, where it
was found that the nasty crack on the skull
had given him a slight concussion. But you
couldn’t keep Pat down. It merely meant
postponing that trip, not cancelling it.</p>
<p>Hal was the hero of the day. The newspapers,
who got the story at the airport,
hounded him until he conquered his shyness,
just to get rid of them. They made the most
of the story, and Hal was almost afraid to
leave the house, for fear some of his friends
would meet him in the street, because Hal
was still the same modest retiring soul that
he had been.</p>
<p>But he did leave the house to go down to
the hospital to see Pat, along with Bob and
Captain Bill. Pat was sitting outside in a
wheelchair when they came, and they sat
down on the grass beside him, and talked
about their postponed trip.</p>
<p>“Do you know,” said Captain Bill,
“when we come back from our trip, there’s
something that’s going to keep me busy.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?” asked Bob.</p>
<p>“I’m going to collect all of those stories
we told into a book. What do you think of
that for an idea?”</p>
<p>“Great!” said Bob. “All of our stories?
Mine, too?”</p>
<p>“Sure, all of them.”</p>
<p>“But Hal won’t have a story. He hasn’t
told one,” said Bob.</p>
<p>“Hal’s going to be the hero,” said the
Captain.</p>
